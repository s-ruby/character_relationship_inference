Note: A lot of this code come from my db TA, but it is a starting off.


To run, but all of these within file, when in the file, run the commands:

sudo pip install --upgrade scipy

pip3 install -U pip setuptools wheel

pip3 install -U spacy

python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

bash download_finetuned.sh



To run, simply call main, "python3 main.py"
