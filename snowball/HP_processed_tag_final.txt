<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  CHAPTER ONE  THE BOY WHO LIVED  Mr. and Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER>, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s had a small son called <PER>Dudley</PER> and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER>'s sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER> pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as un<PER>Dursley</PER>ish as it was possible to be.
Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER> gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming <PER>Dudley</PER> into his high chair.
At half past eight, Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER> on the cheek, and tried to kiss <PER>Dudley</PER> good-bye but missed, because <PER>Dudley</PER> was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, <PER>Harry</PER>"  Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> stopped dead.
While Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER> was in the bathroom, Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER> fell asleep quickly but Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> flinched, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> shot a sharp look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
It seemed that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with such a piercing stare as she did now.
No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.
It must have made sense to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "<PER>Hagrid</PER>'s late.
He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as <PER>Harry</PER> Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about <PER>Harry</PER> -- every child in our world will know his name!"
I would trust <PER>Hagrid</PER> with my life," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
"<PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding relieved.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER> in his arms and turned toward the <PER>Dursley</PER>s' house.
"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little <PER>Harry</PER> off ter live with Muggles -"  "Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, or we'll be found," Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> whispered, patting <PER>Hagrid</PER> gingerly on the arm as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
He laid <PER>Harry</PER> gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s blankets, and then came back to the other two.
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s shoulders shook, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes seemed to have gone out.
G'night, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> -- Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sir."
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, nodding to her.
One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER>'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin <PER>Dudley</PER>...
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the <PER>Dursley</PER>s' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but <PER>Dudley</PER> <PER>Dursley</PER> was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
Exactly why <PER>Dudley</PER> wanted a racing bike was a mystery to <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Dudley</PER> was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody.
<PER>Dudley</PER>'s favorite punching bag was <PER>Harry</PER>, but he couldn't often catch him.
He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of <PER>Dudley</PER>'s, and <PER>Dudley</PER> was about four times bigger than he was.
<PER>Harry</PER> was frying eggs by the time <PER>Dudley</PER> arrived in the kitchen with his mother.
Aunt Petunia often said that <PER>Dudley</PER> looked like a baby angel -- <PER>Harry</PER> often said that <PER>Dudley</PER> looked like a pig in a wig.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who could see a huge <PER>Dudley</PER> tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case <PER>Dudley</PER> turned the table over.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while <PER>Harry</PER> and Uncle Vernon watched <PER>Dudley</PER> unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
<PER>Dudley</PER>'s mouth fell open in horror, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart gave a leap.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s often spoke about <PER>Harry</PER> like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.
"You could just leave me here," <PER>Harry</PER> put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on <PER>Dudley</PER>'s computer).
Half an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER>, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s' car with Piers and <PER>Dudley</PER>, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
The problem was, strange things often happened around <PER>Harry</PER> and it was just no good telling the <PER>Dursley</PER>s he didn't make them happen.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had laughed himself silly at <PER>Harry</PER>, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of <PER>Dudley</PER>'s (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dudley</PER>'s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s had received a very angry letter from <PER>Harry</PER>'s headmistress telling them <PER>Harry</PER> had been climbing school buildings.
He liked to complain about things: people at work, <PER>Harry</PER>, the council, <PER>Harry</PER>, the bank, and <PER>Harry</PER> were just a few of his favorite subjects.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s bought <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked <PER>Harry</PER> what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.
It wasn't bad, either, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like <PER>Dudley</PER>, except that it wasn't blond.
He was careful to walk a little way apart from the <PER>Dursley</PER>s so that <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him.
They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when <PER>Dudley</PER> had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and <PER>Harry</PER> was allowed to finish the first.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, <PER>Dudley</PER> was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst of all, for <PER>Harry</PER> at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "<PER>Harry</PER> was talking to it, weren't you, <PER>Harry</PER>?"
When he had been younger, <PER>Harry</PER> had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were his only family.
Everybody knew that <PER>Dudley</PER>'s gang hated that odd <PER>Harry</PER> Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with <PER>Dudley</PER>'s gang.
<PER>Harry</PER> was glad school was over, but there was no escaping <PER>Dudley</PER>'s gang, who visited the house every single day.
The rest of them were all quite happy to join in <PER>Dudley</PER>'s favorite sport: <PER>Harry</PER> Hunting.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took <PER>Dudley</PER> to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> at Mrs. Figg's.
<PER>Dudley</PER> and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from <PER>Harry</PER>'s new uniform.
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> were still in the room.
roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; <PER>Dudley</PER> won, so <PER>Harry</PER>, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where <PER>Dudley</PER> slept, and one where <PER>Dudley</PER> kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.
The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank <PER>Dudley</PER> had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was <PER>Dudley</PER>'s first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that <PER>Dudley</PER> had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because <PER>Dudley</PER> had sat on it.
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to <PER>Harry</PER>, made <PER>Dudley</PER> go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle <PER>Dudley</PER> to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
<PER>Dudley</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s ducked, but <PER>Harry</PER> leapt into the air trying to catch one.
<PER>Dudley</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
<PER>Dudley</PER> snored but <PER>Harry</PER> stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....
If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on <PER>Dudley</PER> to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was <PER>Harry</PER>'s eleventh birthday.
The lighted dial of <PER>Dudley</PER>'s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told <PER>Harry</PER> he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.
"Anyway -- <PER>Harry</PER>," said the giant, turning his back on the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, "a very happy birthday to yeh.
barked <PER>Hagrid</PER>, turning to stare at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, who shrank back into the shadows.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> stared wildly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." <PER>Hagrid</PER> ran his fingers through his hair, fixing <PER>Harry</PER> with a bewildered stare.
A braver man than Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> would have quailed under the furious look <PER>Hagrid</PER> now gave him; when <PER>Hagrid</PER> spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.
I saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER> leave it, <PER>Dursley</PER>!
Yours sincerely,  Minerva <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  Deputy Headmistress  Questions exploded inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first.
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that <PER>Harry</PER> could read upside down:  Dear Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  Given <PER>Harry</PER> his letter.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>  <PER>Hagrid</PER> rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.
roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>, jumping up so angrily that the <PER>Dursley</PER>s scuttled back to their corner.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped; he had almost forgotten that the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were there.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but <PER>Harry</PER>, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had been upset or angry... chased by <PER>Dudley</PER>'s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time <PER>Dudley</PER> had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, smiling, and saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was positively beaming at him.
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at <PER>Dudley</PER> -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, <PER>Dudley</PER> was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain.
Pulling Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at <PER>Hagrid</PER> and slammed the door behind them.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>'s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
<PER>Harry</PER> counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so <PER>Harry</PER> could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Hagrid</PER> out onto the rock.
They settled down in the boat, <PER>Harry</PER> still staring at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, trying to imagine him flying.
"Seems a shame ter row, though," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> another of his sideways looks.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat and thought about this while <PER>Hagrid</PER> read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet.
Not only was <PER>Hagrid</PER> twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, <PER>Harry</PER>?
"<PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Harry</PER>, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?"
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he called it, gave the bills to <PER>Harry</PER> so he could buy their tickets.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all <PER>Harry</PER> had to do was keep close behind him.
If <PER>Harry</PER> hadn't known that the <PER>Dursley</PER>s had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything <PER>Hagrid</PER> had told him so far was unbelievable, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn't help trusting him.
If <PER>Hagrid</PER> hadn't pointed it out, <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn't have noticed it was there.
In fact, <PER>Harry</PER> had the most peculiar feeling that only he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> could see it.
Everyone seemed to know <PER>Hagrid</PER>; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "The usual, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?"
"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping his great hand on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and making <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees buckle.
Doris Crockford shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand one last time, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> grinned at <PER>Harry</PER>.
"Look," <PER>Harry</PER> heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....  "Gringotts," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> made for the counter.
"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>," said <PER>Hagrid</PER> importantly, throwing out his chest.
Once <PER>Hagrid</PER> had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and <PER>Harry</PER> followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
I never know," <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Hagrid</PER> over the noise of the cart, "what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"
<PER>Hagrid</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> pile some of it into a bag.
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
<PER>Harry</PER> was strongly reminded of <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing there, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
"That's <PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Harry</PER>, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my dear," and <PER>Harry</PER>, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.
<PER>Harry</PER> was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream <PER>Hagrid</PER> had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
<PER>Hagrid</PER> almost had to drag <PER>Harry</PER> away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> wouldn't let <PER>Harry</PER> buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
While <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
Outside the Apothecary, <PER>Hagrid</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>'s list again.
Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do...."  He shook his head and then, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief, spotted <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "  He put <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious... curious..  "Sorry," said <PER>Harry</PER>, "but what's curious?"
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap.
Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; <PER>Harry</PER> only realized where they were when <PER>Hagrid</PER> tapped him on the shoulder.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> on to the train that would take him back to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, then handed him an envelope.
Any problems with the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, <PER>Harry</PER>."
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to watch <PER>Hagrid</PER> until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and <PER>Hagrid</PER> had gone.
CHAPTER SIX  THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS  <PER>Harry</PER>'s last month with the <PER>Dursley</PER>s wasn't fun.
True, <PER>Dudley</PER> was now so scared of <PER>Harry</PER> he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut <PER>Harry</PER> in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
Two hours later, <PER>Harry</PER>'s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the <PER>Dursley</PER>s' car, Aunt Petunia had talked <PER>Dudley</PER> into sitting next to <PER>Harry</PER>, and they had set off.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw the <PER>Dursley</PER>s drive away.
The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when <PER>Harry</PER> couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though <PER>Harry</PER> was being stupid on purpose.
"Bye," said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who found <PER>Ron</PER> just as interesting as <PER>Ron</PER> found him.
After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told <PER>Ron</PER> so, all about having to wear <PER>Dudley</PER>'s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
"... and until <PER>Hagrid</PER> told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or <PER>Voldemort</PER>"  <PER>Ron</PER> gasped.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but <PER>Ron</PER>'s ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared as <PER>Harry</PER> brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.
It was a nice feeling, sitting there with <PER>Ron</PER>, eating their way through all <PER>Harry</PER>'s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
<PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
I might get Agrippa -- thanks  <PER>Harry</PER> turned over his card and read:  ALBUS DUMBLEDORE  CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS  Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face had disappeared.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.
<PER>Ron</PER> was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn't keep his eyes off them.
"You want to be careful with those," <PER>Ron</PER> warned <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.
"I'm <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley," <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
"<PER>Harry</PER> Potter," said <PER>Harry</PER>.
"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter," said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to take <PER>Ron</PER>'s mind off houses.
He was just taking <PER>Harry</PER> through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't <PER>Neville</PER> the toadless boy, or <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger this time.
"And my name's <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>."
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked at him.
He held out his hand to shake <PER>Harry</PER>'s, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn't take it.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.
Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood up.
"Unless you get out now," said <PER>Harry</PER>, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or <PER>Ron</PER>.
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to <PER>Ron</PER> - <PER>Ron</PER> leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.
I think he's been knocked out," <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach lurched with nerves and <PER>Ron</PER>, he saw, looked pale under his freckles.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were followed into their boat by <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
"The firs' years, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.
Her eyes lingered for a moment on <PER>Neville</PER>'s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on <PER>Ron</PER>'s smudged nose.
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, <PER>Harry</PER> got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with <PER>Ron</PER> behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly looked down again as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
<PER>Ron</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Ron</PER>'s twin brothers catcalling.
"Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than <PER>Ron</PER>, joined <PER>Harry</PER> at the Gryffindor table.
<PER>Harry</PER> clapped loudly with the rest as <PER>Ron</PER> collapsed into the chair next to him.
"Well done, <PER>Ron</PER>, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across <PER>Harry</PER> as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s had never exactly starved <PER>Harry</PER>, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had always taken anything that <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted, even if It made him sick.
He was right next to <PER>Malfoy</PER> who, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
On <PER>Harry</PER>'s other side, Percy Weasley and <PER>Hermione</PER> were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was talking to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
Harder to shake off was the feeling <PER>Harry</PER> had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Snape</PER> for a while, but <PER>Snape</PER> didn't look at him again.
<PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> through the hangings.
<PER>Harry</PER> was going to ask <PER>Ron</PER> if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned into the hook-nosed teacher, <PER>Snape</PER>, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and <PER>Harry</PER> woke, sweating and shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.
By the end of the lesson, only <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a rare smile.
Friday was an important day for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> as he poured sugar on his porridge.
"Wish <PER>McGonagall</PER> favored us, " said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>   <PER>Harry</PER> borrowed <PER>Ron</PER>'s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that <PER>Harry</PER> had tea with <PER>Hagrid</PER> to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, <PER>Harry</PER> had gotten the idea that Professor <PER>Snape</PER> disliked him.
<PER>Snape</PER> didn't dislike <PER>Harry</PER> -- he hated him.
<PER>Snape</PER>, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at <PER>Harry</PER>'s name.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.
His eyes were black like <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s, but they had none of <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s warmth.
He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> had y caught every word -- like Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked as stumped as he was; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand had shot into the air.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
He had looked through his books at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s', but did <PER>Snape</PER> expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?
<PER>Snape</PER> was still ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>'s quivering hand.
Then he rounded on <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been working next to <PER>Neville</PER>.
This was so unfair that <PER>Harry</PER> opened his mouth to argue, but <PER>Ron</PER> kicked him behind their cauldron.
"Cheer up," said <PER>Ron</PER>, "<PER>Snape</PER>'s always taking points off Fred and George.
"Make yerselves at home," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at <PER>Ron</PER> and started licking his ears.
"This is <PER>Ron</PER>," <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, glancing at <PER>Ron</PER>'s freckles.
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pretended to be enjoying them as they told <PER>Hagrid</PER> all about their first -lessons.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were delighted to hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> call Fitch "that old git."
<PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER> about <PER>Snape</PER>'s lesson.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, like <PER>Ron</PER>, told <PER>Harry</PER> not to worry about it, that <PER>Snape</PER> liked hardly any of the students.
Yet <PER>Harry</PER> couldn't help thinking that <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Hagrid</PER> had changed the subject on purpose.
While <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER> all about Charlie's work with dragons, <PER>Harry</PER> picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER> telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but <PER>Ron</PER> hadn't mentioned the date.
There was no doubt about it, <PER>Hagrid</PER> definitely didn't meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes this time.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
And did <PER>Hagrid</PER> know something about <PER>Snape</PER> that he didn't want to tell <PER>Harry</PER>?
CHAPTER NINE  THE MIDNIGHT DUEL  <PER>Harry</PER> had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than <PER>Dudley</PER>, but that was before he met <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had caught <PER>Ron</PER> prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
Privately, <PER>Harry</PER> felt she'd had good reason, because <PER>Neville</PER> managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was almost as nervous about flying as <PER>Neville</PER> was.
<PER>Neville</PER> was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn't had a single letter since <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s note, something that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been quick to notice, of course.
Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,  "You've forgotten something..."  <PER>Neville</PER> was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jumped to their feet.
At three-thirty that afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s hadn't moved at all.
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought <PER>Harry</PER>; there was a quaver in <PER>Neville</PER>'s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were delighted when she told <PER>Malfoy</PER> he'd been doing it wrong for years.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --  WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and <PER>Neville</PER> lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
"Give that here, <PER>Malfoy</PER>," said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> yelled, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> only just got out of the way in time; <PER>Harry</PER> made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady.
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, <PER>Malfoy</PER>," <PER>Harry</PER> called.
"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"  "It wasn't his fault, Professor --"  "Be quiet, Miss Patil  "But <PER>Malfoy</PER> --"  "That's enough, Mr. Weasley.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wake as she strode toward the castle.
His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching <PER>Ron</PER> and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s bag.
"Follow me, you two," said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus <PER>Snape</PER> in the face for weeks...."  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> peered sternly over her glasses at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just finished telling <PER>Ron</PER> what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>.
When <PER>Malfoy</PER> had gone, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ignored him and spoke to <PER>Harry</PER>.
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were saying --"  "Bet you could," <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.  "
All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (<PER>Neville</PER> wasn't back from the hospital wing).
On the other hand, <PER>Malfoy</PER>s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> face-to-face.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked at his watch and then glared furiously at <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> opened her mouth, perhaps to tell <PER>Ron</PER> exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but <PER>Harry</PER> hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out his wand in case <PER>Malfoy</PER> leapt in and started at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed <PER>Ron</PER> around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.
<PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, <PER>Harry</PER> in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
"<PER>Malfoy</PER> tricked you," <PER>Hermione</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
For <PER>Neville</PER> had been tugging on the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bathrobe for the last minute.
But <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.
CHAPTER TEN  HALLOWEEN  <PER>Malfoy</PER> couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.
In the meantime, <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Ron</PER> in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
Neither <PER>Neville</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now refusing to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  <PER>Harry</PER> had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to <PER>Ron</PER> to read.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> seized the package from <PER>Harry</PER> and felt it.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Before <PER>Ron</PER> could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s elbow.
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said <PER>Harry</PER>, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s obvious rage and confusion.
"Well, it's true," <PER>Harry</PER> chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen <PER>Neville</PER>'s Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."  "So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?"
<PER>Hermione</PER> was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
"Wow," <PER>Ron</PER> sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedspread.
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and <PER>Harry</PER> were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for <PER>Harry</PER> to catch.
<PER>Harry</PER>'s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because <PER>Neville</PER> had been trying to catch his eye).
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, was to be working with <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
It was hard to tell whether <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> was angrier about this.
"You're saying it wrong," <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> snap.
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that <PER>Hermione</PER> was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put <PER>Hermione</PER> out of their minds.
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly grabbed <PER>Ron</PER>'s arm.
hissed <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> behind a large stone griffin.
"He's heading for the third floor," <PER>Harry</PER> said, but <PER>Ron</PER> held up his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> said desperately to <PER>Ron</PER>, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward <PER>Ron</PER> instead, giving <PER>Harry</PER> time to run around it.
<PER>Harry</PER> yelled at <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.
The troll couldn't feel <PER>Harry</PER> hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had sunk to the floor in fright; <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"
A moment later, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had come bursting into the room, closely followed by <PER>Snape</PER>, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still standing with his wand in the air.
<PER>Snape</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a swift, piercing look.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuck his wand up its nose and <PER>Ron</PER> knocked it out with its own club.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
Hardly anyone had seen <PER>Harry</PER> play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, <PER>Harry</PER> should be kept, well, secret.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed at once that <PER>Snape</PER> was limping.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.
"He's just made that rule up," <PER>Harry</PER> muttered angrily as <PER>Snape</PER> limped away.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat together next to a window.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was checking <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s Charms homework for them.
Getting up, he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> he was going to ask <PER>Snape</PER> if he could have it.
"Better you than me," they said together, but <PER>Harry</PER> had an idea that <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> left, before <PER>Snape</PER> could take any more points from Gryffindor.
<PER>Ron</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> joined them.
"Honestly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you think all teachers are saints or something," snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> was snoring loudly, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn't sleep.
He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face when <PER>Harry</PER> had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined <PER>Neville</PER>, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> squeezed together to give <PER>Hagrid</PER> enough space to join them.
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was <PER>Harry</PER>.
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked <PER>Harry</PER> on purpose, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom spun off course, <PER>Harry</PER> holding on for dear life.
"Dunno what <PER>Harry</PER> thinks he's doing," <PER>Hagrid</PER> mumbled.
<PER>Harry</PER>'s broom had given a wild jerk and <PER>Harry</PER> swung off it.
At these words, <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s binoculars, but instead of looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
"I knew it," <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, "<PER>Snape</PER> -- look."
Before <PER>Ron</PER> could say another word, <PER>Hermione</PER> had disappeared.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned the binoculars back on <PER>Harry</PER>.
"Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>," <PER>Ron</PER> muttered desperately.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had fought her way across to the stand where <PER>Snape</PER> stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
<PER>Neville</PER> had been sobbing into <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s jacket for the last five minutes.
He was being made a cup of strong tea back in <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s hut, with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
"It was <PER>Snape</PER>," <PER>Ron</PER> was explaining, "<PER>Hermione</PER> and I saw him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.
"I don' know why <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom acted like that, but <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn' try an' kill a student!
"I do feel so sorry," said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, one Potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home."
So <PER>Malfoy</PER>, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting <PER>Harry</PER> about having no proper family.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and <PER>Harry</PER> had signed up at once.
<PER>Ron</PER> dived at <PER>Malfoy</PER> just as <PER>Snape</PER> came up the stairs.
<PER>Ron</PER> let go of the front of <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s robes.
"He was provoked, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, <PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Snape</PER> silkily.
"I'll get him," said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinding his teeth at <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s back, "one of these days, I'll get him --"  "I hate them both," said <PER>Harry</PER>, "<PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>."
So the three of them followed <PER>Hagrid</PER> and his tree off to -the Great Hall, where Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
"And that reminds me -<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said <PER>Ron</PER>, and they left <PER>Hagrid</PER> looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since <PER>Hagrid</PER> had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to steal?
<PER>Hermione</PER> took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while <PER>Ron</PER> strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.
Five minutes later, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him, shaking their heads.
Once the holidays had started, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.
<PER>Ron</PER> also started teaching <PER>Harry</PER> wizard chess.
"Merry Christmas," said <PER>Ron</PER> sleepily as <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.
said <PER>Ron</PER>, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than <PER>Harry</PER>'s.
It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To <PER>Harry</PER>, from <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
"You can keep it," said <PER>Harry</PER>, laughing at how pleased <PER>Ron</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw the cloak around his shoulders and <PER>Ron</PER> gave a yell.
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.  "<PER>Harry</PER>'s is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweater.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hagrid</PER> getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> on the cheek, who, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where <PER>Harry</PER> broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood rooted to the spot as Filch and <PER>Snape</PER> came around the corner ahead.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.
And slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had <PER>Harry</PER>'s knobbly knees -- <PER>Harry</PER> was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
just as <PER>Ron</PER> started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted the suit of armor.
<PER>Harry</PER> stepped aside, but with <PER>Ron</PER> in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just <PER>Ron</PER> in his paisley pajamas.
<PER>Ron</PER> tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats?
And <PER>Ron</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> out of the room.
But <PER>Harry</PER> only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and <PER>Ron</PER> wasn't going to stop him.
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to see that he was smiling.
"So," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised."
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might not have been quite truthful.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN  NICOLAS FLAMEL  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had convinced <PER>Harry</PER> not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk.
"You see, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> told him about these drearns.
Which was all very well, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, but he had another reason for not wanting <PER>Snape</PER> near him while he was playing Quidditch....
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> playing chess.
Chess was the only thing <PER>Hermione</PER> ever lost at, something <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought was very good for her.
"Don't talk to me for a moment," said <PER>Ron</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> sat down next to him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, <PER>Harry</PER> told the other two about <PER>Snape</PER>'s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
<PER>Hermione</PER> asked him, leading him over to sit with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
"<PER>Malfoy</PER>," said <PER>Neville</PER> shakily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> urged <PER>Neville</PER>.
"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s already done that," <PER>Neville</PER> choked out.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box <PER>Hermione</PER> had given him for Christmas.
"You're worth twelve of <PER>Malfoy</PER>," <PER>Harry</PER> said.
As <PER>Neville</PER> walked away, <PER>Harry</PER> looked at the Famous Wizard card.
Then he looked up at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.
said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
She pushed the book toward them, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had finished.
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one.
It wasn't until <PER>Ron</PER> said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that <PER>Harry</PER> remembered about <PER>Snape</PER> and the coming match.
"I'm going to play," he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
As the match drew nearer, however, <PER>Harry</PER> became more and more nervous, whatever he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into <PER>Snape</PER> wherever he went.
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, <PER>Snape</PER> was so horrible to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that <PER>Snape</PER> could read minds.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to <PER>Neville</PER>, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.
Little did <PER>Harry</PER> know that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
They'd gotten the idea from <PER>Malfoy</PER> using it on <PER>Neville</PER>, and were ready to use it on <PER>Snape</PER> if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt <PER>Harry</PER>.
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered as <PER>Ron</PER> slipped his wand up his sleeve.
There was simply no way that <PER>Snape</PER> would dare to try to hurt him if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was watching.
Perhaps that was why <PER>Snape</PER> was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that <PER>Ron</PER> noticed, too.
"I've never seen <PER>Snape</PER> look so mean," he told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> didn't answer; <PER>Snape</PER> had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly a few minutes later, as <PER>Snape</PER> awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
<PER>Neville</PER> went bright red but turned in his seat to face <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but <PER>Ron</PER>, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, <PER>Neville</PER>."
<PER>Ron</PER>'s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about <PER>Harry</PER>.
"I'm warning you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> -- one more word  "<PER>Ron</PER>!"
said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, "<PER>Harry</PER> --"  "What?
<PER>Hermione</PER> stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as <PER>Harry</PER> streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
Before <PER>Malfoy</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Ron</PER> was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as <PER>Harry</PER> sped straight at <PER>Snape</PER> -- she didn't even notice <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was <PER>Neville</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, <PER>Snape</PER> turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw <PER>Snape</PER> land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then <PER>Harry</PER> felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s smiling face.
"Well done," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, so that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear.
He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the distance, jumping up and down, <PER>Ron</PER> cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
He'd done it, he'd shown <PER>Snape</PER>....  And speaking of <PER>Snape</PER>...  A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.
shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
"And I gave <PER>Malfoy</PER> a black eye, and <PER>Neville</PER> tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed!
He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that <PER>Snape</PER> needs to break through --"  "So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to <PER>Snape</PER>?"
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
Whenever <PER>Harry</PER> passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and <PER>Ron</PER> had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.
Moaning and yawning, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard <PER>Ron</PER> say, "<PER>Hagrid</PER>!
"<PER>Hagrid</PER>'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said <PER>Harry</PER>.
"Oh, come on, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a warm, flattering voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> beamed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> --" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself did somethin', o' course.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were thinking the same as he was.
"Not a soul knows except me an' <PER>Dumbledore</PER>," said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly.
"Can't, <PER>Harry</PER>, sorry," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
"Ah," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er..."  "Where did you get it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?"
<PER>Hermione</PER> had now started making study schedules for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, too.
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought <PER>Harry</PER> another note from <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn't like the look on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face at all.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, <PER>Hermione</PER> agreed to run down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s with the other two during morning break.
"<PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Hermione</PER>, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?"
Something about the smile lurking on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face during the next week made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> very nervous.
"He's lost his marbles," <PER>Ron</PER> muttered in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
"<PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> could go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at any moment."
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
Wednesday night found <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
<PER>Ron</PER> appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s invisibility cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find <PER>Ron</PER> in a terrible state in bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> tried to calm <PER>Ron</PER> down.
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but this didn't soothe <PER>Ron</PER> at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn't get a chance to answer.
"It's too late to change the plan now," <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sobbed, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had <PER>Malfoy</PER> by the ear.
Come on -- I shall see Professor <PER>Snape</PER> about you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>!"
They showed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
When Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> appeared, she was leading <PER>Neville</PER>.
"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --"  <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head violently to shut <PER>Neville</PER> up, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had seen.
You fed <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Neville</PER>'s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because <PER>Neville</PER> was looking stunned and hurt.
Poor, blundering <PER>Neville</PER> -- <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.
And then the story started to spread: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were suffering, too.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....  Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, <PER>Harry</PER>'s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test.
All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that <PER>Snape</PER> had just left the room, and from what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, <PER>Snape</PER> would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the library, where <PER>Hermione</PER> was testing <PER>Ron</PER> on Astronomy.
"Maybe <PER>Snape</PER>'s found out how to get past him without asking <PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.
The light of adventure was kindling again in <PER>Ron</PER>'s eyes, but <PER>Hermione</PER> answered before <PER>Harry</PER> could.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked convinced, but <PER>Ron</PER> didn't.
The following morning, notes were delivered to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> at the breakfast table.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost.
At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had also forgotten that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had gotten a detention, too.
Ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the lighted windows of <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s hut.
<PER>Harry</PER>'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with <PER>Hagrid</PER> it wouldn't be so bad.
At this, <PER>Neville</PER> let out a little moan, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped dead in his tracks.
<PER>Neville</PER> clutched the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robe and made a choking noise.
All right, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>?"
<PER>Malfoy</PER> now turned to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
So me, <PER>Harry</PER>, an' <PER>Hermione</PER>'ll go one way an' <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, an' Fang'll go the other.
A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> took the left path while <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Fang took the right.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked very worried.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s jaws dropped.
"Oh, it's you, <PER>Ron</PER>an," said <PER>Hagrid</PER> in relief.
"Good evening to you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>," said <PER>Ron</PER>an.
"Can't be too careful, <PER>Ron</PER>an," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, patting his crossbow.
This is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter an' <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, by the way.
"Yeah," said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, "but have yeh seen anythin', <PER>Ron</PER>an?
"Mars is bright tonight," <PER>Ron</PER>an repeated, while <PER>Hagrid</PER> watched him impatiently.
A movement in the trees behind <PER>Ron</PER>an made <PER>Hagrid</PER> raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than <PER>Ron</PER>an.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at <PER>Ron</PER>an and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
They had just passed a bend in the path when <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s arm.
"I don't care if <PER>Malfoy</PER> has, but if something's got <PER>Neville</PER>... it's our fault he's here in the first place."
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Fang were with him.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, it seemed, had sneaked up behind <PER>Neville</PER> and grabbed him as a joke.
Right, we're changin' groups -- <PER>Neville</PER>, you stay with me an' <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, you go with Fang an' this idiot.
I'm sorry," <PER>Hagrid</PER> added in a whisper to <PER>Harry</PER>, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done."
So <PER>Harry</PER> set off into the heart of the forest with <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Fang.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and Fang stood transfixed.
He looked carefully at <PER>Harry</PER>, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
And Firenze whisked around; with <PER>Harry</PER> clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving <PER>Ron</PER>an and Bane behind them.
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned <PER>Harry</PER> to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer <PER>Harry</PER>'s question.
"Do you mean," <PER>Harry</PER> croaked, "that was Vol-"  "<PER>Harry</PER>!
<PER>Hermione</PER> was running toward them down the path, <PER>Hagrid</PER> puffing along behind her.
In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as <PER>Harry</PER> began to tell him and <PER>Hermione</PER> what had happened in the forest.
"<PER>Snape</PER> wants the stone for <PER>Voldemort</PER>... and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought <PER>Snape</PER> just wanted to get rich...."  "Stop saying the name!"
said <PER>Ron</PER> in a terrified whisper, as if he thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear them.
They must show that <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let <PER>Voldemort</PER> kill me....
"So all I've got to wait for now is <PER>Snape</PER> to steal the Stone," <PER>Harry</PER> went on feverishly, "then <PER>Voldemort</PER> will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy."
"<PER>Harry</PER>, everyone says <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With <PER>Dumbledore</PER> around, You-Know-Who won't touch you.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR  In years to come, <PER>Harry</PER> would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected <PER>Voldemort</PER> to come bursting through the door at any moment.
<PER>Neville</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had a bad case of exam nerves because <PER>Harry</PER> couldn't sleep, but the truth was that <PER>Harry</PER> kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn't seem as worried about the Stone as <PER>Harry</PER>.
The idea of <PER>Voldemort</PER> certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what <PER>Snape</PER> or anyone else might be up to.
<PER>Hermione</PER> always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but <PER>Ron</PER> said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
"<PER>Harry</PER>, relax, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s right, the Stone's safe as long as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s around.
And <PER>Neville</PER> will play Quidditch for England before <PER>Hagrid</PER> lets <PER>Dumbledore</PER> down."
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would never betray <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --  <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly jumped to his feet.
"Don't you think it's a bit odd," said <PER>Harry</PER>, scrambling up the grassy slope, "that what <PER>Hagrid</PER> wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?
said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.
"Yes, please," said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> cut him off.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
"We've got to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>," said <PER>Harry</PER>.
"<PER>Hagrid</PER> told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either <PER>Snape</PER> or <PER>Voldemort</PER> under that cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got <PER>Hagrid</PER> drunk.
"We want to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>," said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rather bravely, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought.
"Look," said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --"  Whatever Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had expected, it wasn't that.
"It's tonight," said <PER>Harry</PER>, once he was sure Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was out of earshot.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wheeled round.
He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'"  "Oh, shut up," said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but she agreed to go and watch out for <PER>Snape</PER>.
"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went back to the common room, <PER>Harry</PER> had just said, "At least <PER>Hermione</PER>'s on <PER>Snape</PER>'s tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and <PER>Hermione</PER> came in.
"<PER>Snape</PER> came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and <PER>Snape</PER> went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where <PER>Snape</PER> went."
"After what <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER> have said?
If <PER>Snape</PER> gets hold of the Stone, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s coming back!
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s and wait for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side!
"You're right <PER>Harry</PER>," said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> didn't talk much.
"Nothing, <PER>Neville</PER>, nothing," said <PER>Harry</PER>, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.
"<PER>Neville</PER>, "<PER>Ron</PER> exploded, "get away from that hole and don't be an idiot --"  "Don't you call me an idiot!"
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
"We had to, <PER>Neville</PER>, no time to explain," said <PER>Harry</PER>.
"You'll understand later, <PER>Neville</PER>," said <PER>Ron</PER> as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.
"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," <PER>Ron</PER> whispered in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, but <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head.
"Well, there you are," <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly, "<PER>Snape</PER>'s already got past Fluffy."
"Keep playing," <PER>Ron</PER> warned <PER>Harry</PER> as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was still playing the flute, waved at <PER>Ron</PER> to get his attention and pointed at himself.
As for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on <PER>Snape</PER> at the plant.
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, <PER>Hermione</PER>," said <PER>Harry</PER> as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
"Yeah," said <PER>Ron</PER>, "and lucky <PER>Harry</PER> doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly."
<PER>Ron</PER> went speeding in the direction that <PER>Harry</PER> was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
"<PER>Ron</PER>, you come at it from above -- <PER>Hermione</PER>, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it.
<PER>Ron</PER> dived, <PER>Hermione</PER> rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and <PER>Harry</PER> streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheers echoed around the high chamber.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.
I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...."  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stayed quiet, watching <PER>Ron</PER> think.
"Well, <PER>Harry</PER>, you take the place of that bishop, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle."
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took.
Twice, <PER>Ron</PER> only just noticed in time that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were in danger.
"NOF <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted.
She struck <PER>Ron</PER> hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged <PER>Ron</PER> to one side.
With one last desperate look back at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> charged through the door and up the next passageway.
"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; <PER>McGonagall</PER> transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s."
"<PER>Snape</PER>'s," said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> let out a great sigh and <PER>Harry</PER>, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
<PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at <PER>Harry</PER> and threw her arms around him.
Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, <PER>Snape</PER>, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite <PER>Snape</PER>'s leg off properly.
And to <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself  "Use the boy... Use the boy..."  Quirrell rounded on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> sprang toward the flame door, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> screamed "SEIZE HIM!"
shrieked <PER>Voldemort</PER> again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking <PER>Harry</PER> clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck -- <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
And Quirrell, though pinning <PER>Harry</PER> to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- <PER>Harry</PER> could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw <PER>Harry</PER> off -- the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s yells of, "KILL HIM!
and other voices, maybe in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own head, crying, "<PER>Harry</PER>!
"Good afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER>," said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at the look of amazement on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
"I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --"  "Call him <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave <PER>Harry</PER> time to dry his eyes on the sheet.
"Quirrell said <PER>Snape</PER> --"  "Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>."
And she let <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
"Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, we were sure you were going to -- <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was so worried --"  "The whole school's talking about it," said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when <PER>Harry</PER> told them what was under Quirrell's turban, <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed out loud.
"I brought <PER>Ron</PER> round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, '<PER>Harry</PER>'s gone after him, hasn't he?'
It's almost like he thought I had the right to face <PER>Voldemort</PER> if I could...."  "Yeah, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s off his rocker, all right," said <PER>Ron</PER> proudly.
"Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says you are to be allowed to go," she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn't realize how risky feasts could be.
said <PER>Harry</PER>, shocked to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard.
"<PER>Hagrid</PER>, he'd have found out somehow, this is <PER>Voldemort</PER> we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him."
<PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was so shocked, he stopped crying.
said <PER>Harry</PER> anxiously, and at last <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave a weak chuckle.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn't speak, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> understood.
He slipped into a seat between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> banging his goblet on the table.
Yes...  "First -- to Mr. <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley..."  <PER>Ron</PER> went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
<PER>Hermione</PER> buried her face in her arms; <PER>Harry</PER> strongly suspected she had burst into tears.
"Third -- to Mr. <PER>Harry</PER> Potter..." said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
They had tied for the house cup -- if only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> just one more point.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up to yell and cheer as <PER>Neville</PER>, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still cheering, nudged <PER>Ron</PER> in the ribs and pointed at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.
<PER>Snape</PER> was shaking Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
He caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye and <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Snape</PER>'s feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot.
To their great surprise, both he and <PER>Ron</PER> passed with good marks; <PER>Hermione</PER>, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, <PER>Neville</PER>'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays ("I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said Fred Weasley sadly); <PER>Hagrid</PER> was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> passed through the gateway together.
It was <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, <PER>Ron</PER>'s younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>, looking terrified at the very sight of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hung back for a last word with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Mr.  Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> had been woken in the early hours of  the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew  <PER>Harry</PER>’s room.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to argue back but his words were drowned  by a long, loud belch from the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ son, <PER>Dudley</PER>.
“<PER>Dudley</PER>  gets enough, don’t you, son?”   <PER>Dudley</PER>, who was so large his bottom drooped over  either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the  family was incredible: <PER>Dudley</PER> gasped and fell off his  chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs.  <PER>Dursley</PER> gave a small scream and clapped her hands  to her mouth; Mr. <PER>Dursley</PER> jumped to his feet, veins  throbbing in his temples.
I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION  OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale  aunt, who was trying to heave <PER>Dudley</PER> to his feet.
“All right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “all right ...”   Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded  rhinoceros and watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely out of the  corners of his small, sharp eyes.
Ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had come home for the summer  holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a  bomb that might go off at any moment, because <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter wasn’t a normal boy.
And if the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were unhappy to have  him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how  <PER>Harry</PER> felt.
He missed the castle, with its  secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though  perhaps not <PER>Snape</PER>, the Potions master), the mail  arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall,  sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory,  visiting the gamekeeper, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, in his cabin next to  the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially,  Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding  world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and  fourteen players on broomsticks).
All <PER>Harry</PER>’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and  top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had  been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle  Vernon the instant <PER>Harry</PER> had come home.
What did  the <PER>Dursley</PER>s care if <PER>Harry</PER> lost his place on the House  Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all  summer?
What was it to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s if <PER>Harry</PER> went  back to school without any of his homework done?
This scar was the only  hint of <PER>Harry</PER>’s very mysterious past, of the reason he  had been left on the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ doorstep eleven years  before.
At the age of one year old, <PER>Harry</PER> had somehow  survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all  time, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, whose name most witches and  wizards still feared to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died  in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s attack, but <PER>Harry</PER> had escaped with his  lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood  why — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s powers had been destroyed the  instant he had failed to kill <PER>Harry</PER>.
He had spent ten years with  the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, never understanding why he kept  making odd things happen without meaning to,  believing the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ story that he had got his scar  in the car crash that had killed his parents.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s hadn’t even remembered that today  happened to be <PER>Harry</PER>’s twelfth birthday.
And <PER>Dudley</PER>?”   “I’ll be waiting to open the door.” <PER>Dudley</PER> put on a  foul, simpering smile.
“And, <PER>Dudley</PER>, you 11 say — ”   “May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs.  Mason?” said <PER>Dudley</PER>, offering his fat arm to an  invisible woman.
...”   “Perfect ... <PER>Dudley</PER>?”   “How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our  hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ”   This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and <PER>Harry</PER>.
More than  anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing  Quidditch, <PER>Harry</PER> missed his best friends, <PER>Ron</PER>  Weasley and <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
Neither of them had  written to him all summer, even though <PER>Ron</PER> had said  he was going to ask <PER>Harry</PER> to come and stay.
Countless times, <PER>Harry</PER> had been on the point of  unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with a letter, but it wasn’t worth  the risk.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told the  <PER>Dursley</PER>s this; he knew it was only their terror that he  might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped  them from locking him in the cupboard under the  stairs with his wand and broomstick.
For the first  couple of weeks back, <PER>Harry</PER> had enjoyed muttering  nonsense words under his breath and watching  <PER>Dudley</PER> tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs  would carry him.
But the long silence from <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> feel so cut off from the  magical world that even taunting <PER>Dudley</PER> had lost its  appeal — and now <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had forgotten  his birthday.
He’d almost be       glad of a sight of his archenemy, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, just to  be sure it hadn’t all been a dream.
At  the very end of last term, <PER>Harry</PER> had come face-to-face  with none other than Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> had slipped through <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow  escape, and even now, weeks later, <PER>Harry</PER> kept waking  in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was now, remembering his livid face, his  wide, mad eyes —   <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench.
While <PER>Dudley</PER> lolled around watching and eating ice  cream, <PER>Harry</PER> cleaned the windows, washed the car,  mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and  watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew he shouldn’t have risen to <PER>Dudley</PER>’s  bait, but <PER>Dudley</PER> had said the very thing <PER>Harry</PER> had  been thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any  friends at Hogwarts.
Hurry!”   As he passed the door to the living room, <PER>Harry</PER>  caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and <PER>Dudley</PER> in bow  ties and dinner jackets.
As they stared at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Dudley</PER>’s  voice from the hall.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched  voice <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would carry down the stairs.
If the <PER>Dursley</PER>s hear anything, if they know you’re  here — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter asks if he can help Dobby .
I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts;  that’s <PER>Hermione</PER>, she — ”   But he stopped quickly, because thinking about  <PER>Hermione</PER> was painful.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter  speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-  Named — ”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just  weeks ago ... that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter escaped yet again.”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with  tears.
If <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal  danger.”   “Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in surprise.
“Not — not <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>, sir — ”   But Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be  trying to give <PER>Harry</PER> a hint.
“I mean, there’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  for one thing — you know who <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is, don’t  you?”   Dobby bowed his head.
But, sir” — Dobby’s voice dropped to an  urgent whisper — “there are powers <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  doesn’t ... powers no decent wizard ...”   And before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop him, Dobby bounded off  the bed, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s desk lamp, and started  beating himself around the head with earsplitting  yelps.
Two seconds later  <PER>Harry</PER>, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon         coming into the hall, calling, “<PER>Dudley</PER> must have left  his television on again, the little tyke!”   “Quick!
<PER>Harry</PER> could make out <PER>Hermione</PER>’s neat       writing, <PER>Ron</PER>’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that  looked as though it was from the Hogwarts  gamekeeper, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Yours sincerely,   Mafalda Hopkirk   IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE  Ministry of Magic   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up from the letter and gulped.
Three days later, the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were showing no sign  of relenting, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see any way out of his  situation.
Then the <PER>Dursley</PER>s appeared and <PER>Dudley</PER>  rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.
<PER>Ron</PER> Weasley was outside <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
3      THE BURROW   “<PER>Ron</PER>\” breathed <PER>Harry</PER>, creeping to the window and  pushing it up so they could talk through the bars.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, how did you — What the — ?”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he  was seeing hit him.
Grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> from the front seats were  Fred and George, <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder twin brothers.
But  doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — ”   “I told you, I didn’t — but it’ll take too long to explain  now — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the  <PER>Dursley</PER>s have locked me up and won’t let me come  back, and obviously I can’t magic myself out, because  the Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve done  in three days, so — ”   “Stop gibbering,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“If the <PER>Dursley</PER>s wake up, I’m dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as he  tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up  the car.
<PER>Harry</PER> listened anxiously, but there was no sound  from the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with <PER>Ron</PER>,  Fred reversed as close as possible to <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
“Out of the way, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   Fred and George climbed catlike through the window  into <PER>Harry</PER>’s room.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed around his room, collecting his things  and passing them out of the window to <PER>Ron</PER>.
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and George pushed from the bedroom  side.
“THAT RUDDY OWL!”   “I’ve forgotten Hedwig!”   <PER>Harry</PER> tore back across the room as the landing light  clicked on — he snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed  to the window, and passed it out to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and pulled  as hard as they could.
HE’S GETTING AWAY!”   But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg  slid out of Uncle Vernon’s grasp — <PER>Harry</PER> was in the  car — he’d slammed the door shut —   “Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, and the car  shot suddenly toward the moon.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER> were  all hanging, dumbstruck, out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
“So — what’s the story, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“What’s been happening?”         <PER>Harry</PER> told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d  given <PER>Harry</PER> and the fiasco of the violet pudding.
Can you think  of anyone at school with a grudge against you?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together, instantly.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> explained.
“He hates me.”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said George, turning around.
“Not  Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s son?”   “Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He  was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.”         “And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred,  craning around to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, “Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> came  back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung  — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know- Who’s  inner circle.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had heard these rumors about <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s family  before, and they didn’t surprise him at all.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>  made <PER>Dudley</PER> <PER>Dursley</PER> look like a kind, thoughtful,  and sensitive boy.
Judging by the fact that <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER> usually had the best of everything, his family  was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see <PER>Malfoy</PER>  strutting around a large manor house.
Sending the  family servant to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from going back to  Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing  <PER>Malfoy</PER> would do.
They had landed next to a  tumbledown garage in a small yard, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked  out for the first time at <PER>Ron</PER>’s house.
Then, <PER>Ron</PER>, you  come bounding downstairs going, ‘Mum, look who  turned up in the night!’ and she’ll be all pleased to  see <PER>Harry</PER> and no one need ever know we flew the  car.”   “Right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I sleep at the —  at the top — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on  the house.
“Come in and have some breakfast.”   She turned and walked back into the house and  <PER>Harry</PER>, after a nervous glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, who nodded  encouragingly, followed her.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in an undertone to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ”   But <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help  <PER>Ron</PER>.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s wouldn’t have liked it —  there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed  cutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the  walls, plants <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen spilling from every  flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.
“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” <PER>Harry</PER>  told <PER>Ron</PER> as they crossed the lawn.
Seeing the  shocked look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, <PER>Ron</PER> added, “It doesn’t         hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy  so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.”     He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet  into the air and landed with a thud in the field over  the hedge.
He decided just to drop the first one he  caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing  weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into <PER>Harry</PER>’s  finger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until —   “Wow, <PER>Harry</PER> — that must’ve been fifty feet.
And for your  information, <PER>Harry</PER> arrived this morning in the car  you weren’t intending to fly!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>?” said Mr. Weasley blankly.
“<PER>Harry</PER> who?”   He looked around, saw <PER>Harry</PER>, and jumped.
Very pleased to meet  you, <PER>Ron</PER>’s told us so much about — ”   “ Your sons flew that car to <PER>Harry</PER>’s house and back  last nighti” shouted Mrs. Weasley.
...”   “Let’s leave them to it,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> as  Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Ron</PER> had  covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper  with posters of the same seven witches and wizards,  all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks,  and waving energetically.
...”   But <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning widely, said, “This is the best  house I’ve ever been in.”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears went pink.
What  <PER>Harry</PER> found most unusual about life at <PER>Ron</PER>’s,  however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking  ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to  like him.
He and  <PER>Ron</PER> went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs.  Weasley and <PER>Ginny</PER> already sitting at the kitchen  table.
The moment she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER> accidentally  knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud  clatter.
<PER>Ginny</PER> seemed very prone to knocking things  over whenever <PER>Harry</PER> entered a room.
“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> identical envelopes of yellowish  parchment, addressed in green ink.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  already knows you’re here, <PER>Harry</PER> — doesn’t miss a  trick, that man.
“I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot  of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s things secondhand.”   “Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Fortunately no  one saw this except <PER>Harry</PER>, because just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s  elder brother Percy walked in.
I wrote to her saying we were  going to try and rescue you from the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.”   He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door  and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped  straight off again so <PER>Ron</PER> laid him on the draining  board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped  open <PER>Hermione</PER>’s letter and read it out loud:   “ ‘Dear <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> if you’re there,   “ ‘I hope everything went all right and that <PER>Harry</PER> is  okay and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him  out, <PER>Ron</PER>, because that would get <PER>Harry</PER> into trouble,  too.
I’ve been really worried and if <PER>Harry</PER> is all right,  will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it  would be better if you used a different owl, because I  think another delivery might finish your one off   “ ‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’ — How can  she be?” said <PER>Ron</PER> in horror.
“What ’re you all up to today?”         <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George were planning to go up  the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned.
They took turns riding  <PER>Harry</PER>’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the  best broom; <PER>Ron</PER>’s old Shooting Star was often  outstripped by passing butterflies.
Nose still  stinging where it had hit the hearth, <PER>Harry</PER> made his  way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before  he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on  the other side of the glass — and one of them was the  very last person <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to meet when he was  lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses:  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> crossed the shop, looking lazily  at the items on display, and rang a bell on the  counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch  nothing, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I  thought you were going to buy me a present.”         “I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his  father, drumming his fingers on the counter.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning  Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s list and scurrying over to <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Your son has fine taste,  sir.”         “I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a  plunderer, Borgin,” said Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> coldly, and Mr.  Borgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant     “Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for     “It’s not my fault,” retorted <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“The teachers all  have favorites, that <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger — ”   “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of  no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped  Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Ha!” said <PER>Harry</PER> under his breath, pleased to see  <PER>Malfoy</PER> looking both abashed and angry.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched nervously as  <PER>Malfoy</PER> drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place,  examining the objects for sale.
“Come, <PER>Malfoy</PER>     <PER>Harry</PER> wiped his forehead on his sleeve as <PER>Malfoy</PER>  turned away.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked in relief.
“I was lost — Floo  powder — ”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER> by the scruff of the neck and  pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray  right out of her hands.
“Yer a mess!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, brushing soot off  <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a  barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.
“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy  place, <PER>Harry</PER> — don’ want no one ter see yeh down  there — ”   “I realized that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ducking as <PER>Hagrid</PER> made  to brush him off again.
“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  as <PER>Harry</PER> jogged alongside him (he had to take three  steps to every stride of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s enormous boots).
<PER>Harry</PER> explained all about Dobby and the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
Over here!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger standing  at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts.
Hello, <PER>Hagrid</PER> — Oh,  it’s wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming  into Gringotts, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked around: Sprinting up the  crowded street were <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, George, Percy, and  Mr. Weasley.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — oh, my dear — you could have been  anywhere — ”   Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush  out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot <PER>Hagrid</PER>  hadn’t managed to beat away.
“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they climbed the  Gringotts steps.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> and his father.”   “Did Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley  sharply behind them.
Don’t go biting off more  than you can chew — ”   “So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>?”  said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted  almost at once by the sight of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s parents,  who were standing nervously at the counter that ran  all along the great marble hall, waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER>  to introduce them.
“Meet you back here,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER> as the  Weasleys and <PER>Harry</PER> were led off to their underground  vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> strolled off along the  winding, cobbled street.
<PER>Ron</PER> gazed  longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the  windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until  <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged them off to buy ink and parchment  next door.
He wants to be Minister of Magic ...”  <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in an undertone as they  left Percy to it.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> squeezed inside.
He saw  <PER>Ron</PER> — and then he saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then he  leapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart  dived forward, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, and pulled him to  the front.
“Together, you and I are worth  the front page.”   When he finally let go of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, <PER>Harry</PER> could  hardly feel his fingers.
He straightened up  and found himself face-to-face with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  who was wearing his usual sneer.
“Famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> went scarlet as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  fought their way over, both clutching stacks of  Lockhart’s books.
“Oh, it’s you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> as if he  were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe.
“Bet you’re surprised to see <PER>Harry</PER> here, eh?”   “Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop,  Weasley,” retorted <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I suppose your parents  will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.”   <PER>Ron</PER> went as red as <PER>Ginny</PER>.
He dropped his books into  the cauldron, too, and started toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed the back of his jacket.
“Dear me, what’s  the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if  they don’t even pay you well for it?”   Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“The company you keep, Weasley ...  and I thought your family could sink no lower — ”   There was a thud of metal as <PER>Ginny</PER>’s cauldron went  flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  knocking him backward into a bookshelf.
“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your  father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  grip he beckoned to <PER>Malfoy</PER> and swept from the shop.
“Rotten ter the core, the whole  family, everyone knows that — no <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s worth  listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on  now — let’s get outta here.”   The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop  them from leaving, but he barely came up to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  waist and seemed to think better of it.
It was difficult not to feel  jealous of <PER>Ron</PER> when he thought of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s and  the sort of welcome he could expect next time he  turned up on Privet Drive.
When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley  glanced into the back seat, where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred,  George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by  side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give  them credit for, don’t they?” She and <PER>Ginny</PER> got into  the front seat, which had been stretched so that it  resembled a park bench.
“I’ll take <PER>Ginny</PER> and you two come right after us,” Mrs.  Weasley told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, grabbing <PER>Ginny</PER>’s hand  and setting off.
“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” <PER>Ron</PER> said  to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward;  <PER>Ron</PER>’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, <PER>Harry</PER> was  knocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto  the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking  indignantly; people all around them stared and a  guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think  you’re doing?”   “Lost control of the trolley,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, clutching  his ribs as he got up.
“Why can’t we get through?” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The <PER>Dursley</PER>s haven’t  given me pocket money for about six years.”   <PER>Ron</PER> pressed his ear to the cold barrier.
“We’re attracting too much atten — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his eyes gleaming.
Then there was a popping noise and the car, <PER>Harry</PER>,  and <PER>Ron</PER> reappeared.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> had pulled off their  sweaters, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-shirt was sticking to the back  of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the  end of his sweaty nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged nervous glances.
“Not far,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, more to the car than to <PER>Harry</PER>,   “not far now,” and he patted the dashboard  nervously.
“There!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, making <PER>Ron</PER> and Hedwig  jump.
Steam was billowing from under the  crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a  golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on <PER>Harry</PER>’s head  where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, <PER>Ron</PER>  let out a low, despairing groan.
“What’s happen — ?”   <PER>Ron</PER> gasped, staring through the windshield, and  <PER>Harry</PER> looked around just in time to see a branch as       thick as a python smash into it.
“Aaargh!” said <PER>Ron</PER> as another twisted limb punched a  large dent into his door; the windshield was now  trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like  twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was  pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be  caving —   “Run for it!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, throwing his full weight  against his door, but next second he had been  knocked backward into <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap by a vicious  uppercut from another branch.
“Hey — <PER>Harry</PER> — come and look — it’s the Sorting!”   <PER>Harry</PER> hurried over and, together, he and <PER>Ron</PER> peered  in at the Great Hall.
For a few  horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going  to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned  out more Dark witches and wizards than any other —  but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the rest of the Weasleys.
Last term,  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had helped Gryffindor win the House  Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in  seven years.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes  wandered past him to where Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the  staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon  glasses shining brightly in the candlelight.
“Hang on ...” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
... Where’s <PER>Snape</PER>?”   Professor Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite  teacher.
<PER>Harry</PER> also happened to be <PER>Snape</PER> ’s least  favorite student.
“Maybe he’s left,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because he missed out  on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).”   “Or he might have been sacked).” said <PER>Ron</PER>  enthusiastically.
He was a thin  man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy,  shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he  was smiling in a way that told <PER>Harry</PER> he and <PER>Ron</PER> were  in very deep trouble.
Not daring even to look at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  followed <PER>Snape</PER> up the steps into the vast, echoing  entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches.
This wasn’t the first time <PER>Snape</PER> had  given <PER>Harry</PER> the impression of being able to read  minds.
You will wait  here.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at each other, white-faced.
If <PER>Snape</PER> had gone to fetch  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, head of Gryffindor House, they  were hardly any better off.
Ten minutes later, <PER>Snape</PER> returned, and sure enough  it was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> who accompanied him.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> angry on  several occasions, but either he had forgotten just  how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen  her this angry before.
She raised her wand the  moment she entered; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both flinched,  but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace,  where flames suddenly erupted.
I believe you  have an owl?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said coldly to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — I didn’t think — ”   “That,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “is obvious.”   There was a knock on the office door and <PER>Snape</PER>, now  looking happier than ever, opened it.
He stared down his very  crooked nose at them, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly found  himself wishing he and <PER>Ron</PER> were still being beaten up  by the Whomping Willow.
He told  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> everything except that Mr. Weasley  owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though  he and <PER>Ron</PER> had happened to find a flying car parked  outside the station.
He knew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would see  through this at once, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked no  questions about the car.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He cleared his throat and said, “Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, these boys have flouted the Decree for  the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious  damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of  this nature — ”   “It will be for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to decide on these  boys’ punishments, Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  calmly.
Come, Severus, there’s a delicious-  looking custard tart I want to sample — ”   <PER>Snape</PER> shot a look of pure venom at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> as  he allowed himself to be swept out of his office,  leaving them alone with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who  was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.
“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  said sharply, but <PER>Harry</PER> cut in: “Professor, when we  took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor  shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should  it?” he finished, watching her anxiously.
As for  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s writing to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, that was  nothing.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> raised her wand again and  pointed it at <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk.
“You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding almost as severe as Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Skip the lecture,” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently, “and tell us  the new password.”   “It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, “but  that’s not the point — ”   Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of  the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden  storm of clapping.
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> inside, leaving <PER>Hermione</PER> to scramble  in after them.
Flying a car right into the Whomping  Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years —     “Good for you,” said a fifth year <PER>Harry</PER> had never  spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as  though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George  pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said  together, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?”  <PER>Ron</PER> was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly,  but <PER>Harry</PER> could see one person who didn’t look happy  at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> nudged  <PER>Ron</PER> in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction.
“ ’Night,” <PER>Harry</PER> called back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was  wearing a scowl just like Percy’s.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned guiltily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down at the Gryffindor table next to  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had her copy of Voyages with  Vampires propped open against a milk jug.
<PER>Neville</PER> was a  round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst  memory of anyone <PER>Harry</PER> had ever met.
A big, lumpy package bounced off <PER>Neville</PER>’s  head and, a second later, something large and gray  fell into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jug, spraying them all with milk  and feathers.
It looked quite  ordinary to <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were both  looking at it as though they expected it to explode.
“You’d better open it, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> in a timid  whisper.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat stunned, as  though a tidal wave had just passed over them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> closed Voyages with Vampires and looked  down at the top of <PER>Ron</PER>’s head.
“Well, I don’t know what you expected, <PER>Ron</PER>, but you     “Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the castle together,  crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the  greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just  joined them when she came striding into view across  the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart.
He was about to follow <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Harry</PER>.”   Completely nonplussed, <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   It was remarkable how he could show every one of  those brilliant teeth even when he wasn’t talking.
You got onto the front  page of the paper with me and you couldn’t wait to do  it again.”   “Oh, no, Professor, see — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, reaching out  and grasping his shoulder.
All that business with <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>!”  He glanced at the lightning scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning  Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five  times in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s  a start”   He gave <PER>Harry</PER> a hearty wink and strode off.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had taken his place between <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes  today.
Who  can tell me why?”   <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand narrowly missed <PER>Harry</PER>’s glasses as  it shot up again.
They looked quite  unremarkable to <PER>Harry</PER>, who didn’t have the slightest  idea what <PER>Hermione</PER> meant by the “cry” of the  Mandrake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were joined at their tray by  a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy <PER>Harry</PER> knew by sight but  had never spoken to.
... And you’re <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger   — always top in everything” (<PER>Hermione</PER> beamed as she  had her hand shaken too) “ — and <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley.
“ ‘It’s your  own fault your wand got snapped — ’ ”   They went down to lunch, where <PER>Ron</PER>’s mood was not  improved by <PER>Hermione</PER>’s showing them the handful of  perfect coat buttons she had produced in  T ransfiguration .
“Why,” demanded <PER>Ron</PER>, seizing her schedule, “have  you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?”         <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched the schedule back, blushing  furiously.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood talking about Quidditch  for several minutes before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that  he was being closely watched.
You’re giving out signed photos,  Potter?”   Loud and scathing, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice echoed  around the courtyard.
“<PER>Harry</PER>  Potter’s giving out signed photos!”   “No, I’m not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, his fists clenching.
“Eat slugs, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“It’d be worth more than his family’s whole  house — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but <PER>Hermione</PER>  shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and  whispered, “Look out!”   “What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart  was striding toward them, his turquoise robes  swirling behind him.
We meet  again, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   Pinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with  humiliation, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> slide smirking back  into the crowd.
The rest of the class came clattering in, and <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’d better hope Creevey doesn’t meet <PER>Ginny</PER>, or  they’ll be starting a <PER>Harry</PER> Potter fan club.”   “Shut up,” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>.
Where is  Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> raised a trembling hand.
In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart  straightened up, caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were almost at the door, and said,  “Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them  back into their cage.” He swept past them and shut  the door quickly behind him.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing     “Rubbish,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Nothing seemed to give Colin a  bigger thrill than to say, “All right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” six or  seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back,  however exasperated <PER>Harry</PER> sounded when he said it.
Hedwig was still angry with <PER>Harry</PER> about the  disasterous car journey and <PER>Ron</PER>’s wand was still  malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning  by shooting out of <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand in Charms and hitting  tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes,  creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had  struck.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were planning to visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> on Saturday  morning.
“Meet you on the field in  fifteen minutes.”   When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on  his cloak for warmth, <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled a note to <PER>Ron</PER>  explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral  staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two  Thousand on his shoulder.
That’s it,  really.”   But Colin didn’t stop questioning <PER>Harry</PER> all the way  down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and  <PER>Harry</PER> only shook him off when he reached the  changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping  voice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, <PER>Harry</PER>!” and hurried  off to the stands.
As <PER>Harry</PER>  walked onto the field, he saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  sitting in the stands.
“Haven’t even started,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking jealously  at the toast and marmalade <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had  brought out of the Great Hall.
It was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Aren’t you Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s son?” said Fred, looking  at <PER>Malfoy</PER> with dislike.
“A field invasion.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were crossing the grass to see  what was going on.
“What’s happening?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said something  really bad because there was an instant uproar at his  words.
Flint had to dive in front of <PER>Malfoy</PER> to stop Fred  and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How  dare you\”, and <PER>Ron</PER> plunged his hand into his robes,  pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face.
“We’d better get him to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, it’s nearest,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who nodded bravely, and the pair  of them pulled <PER>Ron</PER> up by the arms.
“Can you hold him still, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Get out of the way, Colin!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
He and  <PER>Hermione</PER> supported <PER>Ron</PER> out of the stadium and  across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.
“Nearly there, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as the  gamekeeper’s cabin came into view.
“You’ll be all right  in a minute — almost there — ”   They were within twenty feet of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house when  the front door opened, but it wasn’t <PER>Hagrid</PER> who  emerged.
“Quick, behind here,” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, dragging <PER>Ron</PER>  behind a nearby bush.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then  pulled <PER>Ron</PER> out of the bush and up to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s front  door.
“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come  in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor  Lockhart back again — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> supported <PER>Ron</PER> over the  threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an  enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily  in the other.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t seem perturbed by <PER>Ron</PER>’s  slug problem, which <PER>Harry</PER> hastily explained as he  lowered <PER>Ron</PER> into a chair.
“Get ’em all up,  <PER>Ron</PER>.”   “I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it  to stop,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, watching <PER>Ron</PER> bend  over the basin.
“What did Lockhart want with you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked, scratching Fang’s ears.
If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.”   It was most unlike <PER>Hagrid</PER> to criticize a Hogwarts  teacher, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at him in surprise.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> obviously thought he was the  best man for the job — ”   “He was the on’y man for the job,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while <PER>Ron</PER>  coughed squelchily into his basin.
So tell me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  jerking his head at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Who was he tryin’ ter  curse?”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> called <PER>Hermione</PER> something — it must’ve been  really bad, because everyone went wild.”   “It was bad,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, emerging over the  tabletop looking pale and sweaty.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> called her  ‘Mudblood,’ <PER>Hagrid</PER> — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs  made their appearance.
Look at <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom  — he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a  cauldron the right way up.”   “An’ they haven’t invented a spell our <PER>Hermione</PER> can’  do,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly, making <PER>Hermione</PER> go a  brilliant shade of magenta.
“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, <PER>Ron</PER>,”  said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly over the thuds of more slugs  hitting the basin.
Least  yer not in trouble.”   <PER>Harry</PER> would have pointed out that trouble didn’t  come much worse than having slugs pouring out of  your mouth, but he couldn’t; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s treacle toffee  had cemented his jaws together.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> abruptly as though struck by a  sudden thought.
Treacle toffee, <PER>Ron</PER>?” he added as  <PER>Ron</PER> reappeared.
“Better not risk it.”   “Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> as  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> finished the last of their tea.
In the small vegetable patch behind <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s house  were a dozen of the largest pumpkins <PER>Harry</PER> had ever  seen.
“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help     <PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s flowery pink umbrella leaning  against the back wall of the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had  reason to believe before now that this umbrella was  not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression  that <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s old school wand was concealed inside it.
He had been  expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but <PER>Harry</PER>  had never found out why — any mention of the  matter and <PER>Hagrid</PER> would clear his throat loudly and  become mysteriously deaf until the subject was  changed.
“Well,  you’ve done a good job on them.”   “That’s what yer little sister said,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  nodding at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Met her jus’ yesterday.” <PER>Hagrid</PER>  looked sideways at <PER>Harry</PER>, his beard twitching.
“Watch it!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> roared, pulling <PER>Ron</PER> away from his  precious pumpkins.
They said good-bye to <PER>Hagrid</PER>  and walked back up to the castle, <PER>Ron</PER> hiccoughing  occasionally, but only bringing up two very small  slugs.
Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> slouched into the Great Hall in states  of deepest gloom, <PER>Hermione</PER> behind them, wearing a  well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression.
<PER>Harry</PER> let Lockhart’s voice  wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and  “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase  like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, <PER>Harry</PER>,” or “Celebrity is as  celebrity does, remember that.”   The candles burned lower and lower, making the light  dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart  watching him.
How was it with Lockhart?”   Keeping his voice low so as not to wake <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean,  and Seamus, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> exactly what he had  heard.
With a  quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on  his way back, <PER>Harry</PER> picked up the envelope and read:   KWIKSPELL   A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic   Intrigued, <PER>Harry</PER> flicked the envelope open and pulled  out the sheaf of parchment inside.
“We’ll have Peeves  out this time, my sweet — ”   His eyes fell on <PER>Harry</PER> and then darted to the  Kwikspell envelope, which, <PER>Harry</PER> realized too late,  was lying two feet away from where it had started.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — would I be asking too much  — but no, you wouldn’t want — ”   “What is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A deathday party?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> keenly when  <PER>Harry</PER> had changed at last and joined her and <PER>Ron</PER> in  the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was at the point of telling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the  salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting  loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the  room.
The rest  of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween  feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the  usual live bats, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s vast pumpkins had been      carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit  in, and there were rumors that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the  entertainment.
“A promise is a promise,” <PER>Hermione</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>  bossily.
“You said you’d go to the deathday party.”   So at seven o’clock, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked  straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall,  which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and  candles, and directed their steps instead toward the  dungeons.
“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s  looking?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, nudging <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  painfully in the ribs.
“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> and giving a huge, fake jump of  astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the  crowd howled with laughter).
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’re you — ?”   “It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ”   soo hungry ... for so long ...”   “Listen!” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  froze, watching him.
<PER>Harry</PER> sprinted up the marble staircase to the first  floor, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> clattering behind him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’re we — ”   “SHH!”   <PER>Harry</PER> strained his ears.
...I SMELL BLOOD\”   His stomach lurched —         “It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring  <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bewildered faces, he ran up the  next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen  over his own pounding footsteps —   <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled around the whole of the second floor,  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> panting behind him, not stopping  until they turned a corner into the last, deserted  passage.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what was that all about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, wiping  sweat off his face.
As they edged nearer, <PER>Harry</PER> almost slipped — there  was a large puddle of water on the floor; <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed him, and they inched toward the  message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> said,  “Let’s get out of here.”   “Shouldn’t we try and help — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began  awkwardly.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood alone, in the middle of the  corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students  pressing forward to see the grisly sight.
You’ll be next,  Mudbloods!”   It was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
In seconds, he had swept  past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and detached Mrs.  Norris from the torch bracket.
Lockhart,  looking excited and important, hurried after  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; so did Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and  <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged  tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of  candlelight, watching.
“He saw my Kwikspell  letter!”   “If I might speak, Headmaster,” said <PER>Snape</PER> from the  shadows, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s sense of foreboding increased;  he was sure nothing <PER>Snape</PER> had to say was going to  do him any good.
Why wasn’t he  at the Halloween feast?”         <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> all launched into an  explanation about the deathday party.
“Why go  up to that corridor?”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
There is no evidence at all that Potter has done  anything wrong.”       <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was giving <PER>Harry</PER> a searching look.
“You may go,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Hearing voices no  one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the  wizarding world.”   Something in <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice made <PER>Harry</PER> ask, “You do  believe me, don’t you?”   “ ’Course I do,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly.
I’m only joking — ” <PER>Ron</PER>  added hastily as <PER>Ginny</PER> blanched.
Nor could <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> get much response from her  when they asked what she was up to, and not until  the following Wednesday did they find out.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been held back in Potions, where <PER>Snape</PER>  had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off         the desks.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> at the back of the library, measuring  his History of Magic homework.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER>’s done four  feet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.”   “Where is she?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing the tape  measure and unrolling his own homework.
I think she’s  trying to read the whole library before Christmas.”   <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> about Justin Finch-Fletchley running  away from him.
“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken  out,” she said, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber  of Secrets.”   “What’s that?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“And I can’t find the story anywhere  else — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, let me read your composition,” said <PER>Ron</PER>  desperately, checking his watch.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way to  History of Magic, bickering.
“I repeat, if the likes of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>     “But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but  Professor Binns had had enough.
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old  loony,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they fought  their way through the teeming corridors at the end of  the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded fervently, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t say  anything.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that the  Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in  Slytherin.
“Hiya, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “Hullo, Colin,” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — a boy in my class has been saying  you’re — ”     But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the  tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they  heard him squeak, “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>!” and he was  gone.
“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?”   <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “have you, <PER>Ron</PER>?
“I never knew that,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking at <PER>Ron</PER> in  surprise.
“That’s a girls’  toilet.”   “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, there won’t be anyone in there,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, standing up and coming over.
When she reached it she said,  “Hello, Myrtle, how are you?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went to look.
“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously.
“Ask her if she saw anything,” <PER>Harry</PER> mouthed at  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood with their mouths open, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that  was almost cheerful for Myrtle.
“Listen, we never laid a  finger on that cat!”   “That’s what I told <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said Percy fiercely, “but  she still seems to think you’re going to be expelled,   I’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you  might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly  overexcited by this business — ”   “ You don’t care about <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose ears  were now reddening.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> chose seats as far as  possible from Percy in the common room that night.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise, <PER>Hermione</PER>  followed suit.
“If you’re talking about <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ”   “Of course I am!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You heard him — ‘You’ll  be next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to  look at his foul rat face to know it’s him — ”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, the Heir of Slytherin?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  skeptically.
“What we’d need to  do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and  ask <PER>Malfoy</PER> a few questions without him realizing it’s  us.”     “But that’s impossible,” <PER>Harry</PER> said as <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“All we’d need would be  some Polyjuice Potion.”   “What’s that?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“<PER>Snape</PER> mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ”   “D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions  than listen to <PER>Snape</PER>?” muttered <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the  potions.”   “I think,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “that if we made it sound as  though we were just interested in the theory, we  might stand a chance.
He usually picked <PER>Harry</PER> to help him with these  reconstructions; so far, <PER>Harry</PER> had been forced to play  a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had  cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold,  and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything  except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.
“Nice loud howl, <PER>Harry</PER> — exactly — and then, if you’ll  believe it, I pounced — like this — slammed him to  the floor — thus — with one hand, I managed to hold  him down — with my other, I put my wand to his  throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength     and performed the immensely complex Homorphus  Charm — he let out a piteous moan — go on, <PER>Harry</PER> —  higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the  fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man.
<PER>Harry</PER> returned to the back  of the room, where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting.
“All right ...”   She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper  clutched tightly in her hand, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> right  behind her.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, while <PER>Hermione</PER> folded the  note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> made an indistinct noise in his throat and then  hurried off after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously,  trying to take the note from <PER>Hermione</PER>; but <PER>Hermione</PER>  wouldn’t let go.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  had overridden <PER>Ron</PER>’s objections by pointing out that  it was the last place anyone in their right minds  would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> turned, speechless, to <PER>Harry</PER>, who had another  worry.
But if you don’t want to find out if it’s <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’ll go  straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back  in — ”     “I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be  persuading us to break rules,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But not toenails, okay?”   “How long will it take to make, anyway?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  as <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking happier, opened the book again.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> could have attacked  half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he  added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full  steam ahead, I say.”   However, while <PER>Hermione</PER> was checking that the coast  was clear for them to leave the bathroom, <PER>Ron</PER>  muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can  just knock <PER>Malfoy</PER> off his broom tomorrow.”   <PER>Harry</PER> woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a  while thinking about the coming Quidditch match.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> came hurrying  over to wish <PER>Harry</PER> good luck as he entered the locker  rooms.
“I haven’t been properly dry since  August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the  day they let that little bit of slime, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, buy his  way onto their team.”   Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Get to that Snitch before <PER>Malfoy</PER> or die trying,  <PER>Harry</PER>, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.”   “So no pressure, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Fred, winking at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw George give the  Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian  Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair  and shot straight for <PER>Harry</PER> again.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped quickly to avoid it, and George  managed to hit it hard toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as  though it was magnetically attracted to <PER>Harry</PER>, the  Bludger pelted after him once more and <PER>Harry</PER> was  forced to fly off at full speed.
He could hear laughter from the  crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the  rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change  direction as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could; he began a kind  of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium,  squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the  Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying  to get past Wood —   A whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear told him the Bludger had  just missed him again; he turned right over and sped  in the opposite direction.
“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled <PER>Malfoy</PER> as  <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair  to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing  a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at       <PER>Malfoy</PER> in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch.
It  was hovering inches above <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s left ear — and  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, busy laughing at <PER>Harry</PER>, hadn’t seen it.
For an agonizing moment, <PER>Harry</PER> hung in midair, not  daring to speed toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> in case he looked up  and saw the Snitch.
Dimly, dazed by the searing  pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-  drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his  right arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger  came pelting back for a second attack, this time  aiming at his face — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved out of the way,  one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the  shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes  widen with fear: <PER>Malfoy</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was attacking  him.
“Great capture, <PER>Harry</PER>, really  spectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ”   Through the thicket of legs around him, <PER>Harry</PER>  spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue         Bludger into a box.
“No — don’t — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> weakly, but Lockhart was  twirling his wand and a second later had directed it  straight at <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> waited outside the curtain drawn around  <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed while <PER>Ron</PER> helped him into his pajamas.
“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  eh?” <PER>Ron</PER> called through the curtain as he pulled  <PER>Harry</PER>’s limp fingers through the cuff.
“If <PER>Harry</PER> had  wanted deboning he would have asked.”   “Anyone can make a mistake,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And it  doesn’t hurt anymore, does it, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting into bed.
Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and  inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> to help <PER>Harry</PER> gulp down some water.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> didn’t seem too happy.”   They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of  pumpkin juice; they gathered around <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed and  were just getting started on what promised to be a  good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over,         shouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty- three  bones to regrow!
Why didn’t <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter go back home when he missed the train?”   <PER>Harry</PER> heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed  Dobby’s sponge away.
“Dobby hid and watched for  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had       to iron his hands afterward” — he showed <PER>Harry</PER> ten  long, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir,  for he thought <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was safe, and never did  Dobby dream that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter would get to school  another way!”   He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his  ugly head.
Dobby only wanted <PER>Harry</PER> Potter hurt  enough to be sent home!”   “Oh, is that all?” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
Dobby remembers how it  was when <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> was at the  height of his powers, sir!
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter survived, and the Dark Lord’s  power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of  us who thought the Dark days would never end, sir.
... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to  happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby  cannot let <PER>Harry</PER> Potter stay here now that history is  to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is  open once more — ”         Dobby froze, horrors truck, then grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s  water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over  his own head, toppling out of sight.
“Dark  deeds are planned in this place, but <PER>Harry</PER> Potter  must not be here when they happen — go home,   <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, go home.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter must not meddle  in this, sir, ’tis too dangerous — ”   “Who is it, Dobby?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, keeping a firm hold on  Dobby’s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with  the water jug again.
“Go home, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, go home!”   “I’m not going anywhere!” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> hurried past the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s  bed out of sight.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...”   And from what <PER>Harry</PER> could see of Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s shadowy face, she didn’t understand  this any better than he did.
“When you’ve finished eating,  you may leave.”   <PER>Harry</PER> dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off  to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t  there.
Gryffindor has just taken  the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points!”   “You haven’t seen <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>, have you?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I hope  <PER>Ron</PER>’s not in another girls’ toilet ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight,  and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s  bathroom.
He couldn’t see why <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  would be in there again, but after making sure that  neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened  the door and heard their voices coming from a locked  stall.
“We ’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get  started on the Polyjuice Potion,” <PER>Ron</PER> explained as         <PER>Harry</PER>, with difficulty, locked the stall again.
“We’ve  decided this is the safest place to hide it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> started to tell them about Colin, but <PER>Hermione</PER>  interrupted.
That’s why we  decided we’d better get going — ”   “The sooner we get a confession out of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, the  better,” snarled <PER>Ron</PER>.
He  was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match,  he took it out on Colin.”   “There’s something else,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching  <PER>Hermione</PER> tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing  them into the potion.
“Dobby came to visit me in the  middle of the night.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up, amazed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> listened with their mouths  open.
“Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve opened the Chamber when he  was at school here and now he’s told dear old <PER>Malfoy</PER>  how to do it.
“Or  maybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of       armor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon  Ghouls — ”     “You read too much, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pouring  dead lacewings on top of the leeches.
<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in  Charms, was distraught, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Fred and  George were going the wrong way about cheering her  up.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> signed her list;  they had heard that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was staying, which struck  them as very suspicious.
<PER>Harry</PER> privately felt he’d  rather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let  <PER>Snape</PER> catch him robbing his office.
Then one of us can sneak into <PER>Snape</PER>’s  office and take what we need.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her nervously.
So all you need to do is cause enough  mayhem to keep <PER>Snape</PER> busy for five minutes or so.”   <PER>Harry</PER> smiled feebly.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was <PER>Snape</PER>’s  favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew that if they retaliated they  would get detention faster than you could say  “Unfair.”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he  had his mind on more important things.
He was  waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s signal, and he hardly listened  as <PER>Snape</PER> paused to sneer at his watery potion.
When  <PER>Snape</PER> turned and walked off to bully <PER>Neville</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and nodded.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> got a faceful and his nose began to  swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his  hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size  of a dinner plate — <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to restore calm  and find out what had happened.
Through the  confusion, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> slip quietly into  <PER>Snape</PER>’s office.
“Anyone who has  been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught —  when I find out who did this — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> tried not to laugh as he watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> hurry  forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose  like a small melon.
As half the class lumbered up to  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like  clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-  up lips, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> slide back into the  dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.
“If I ever find out who threw this,” <PER>Snape</PER> whispered, “I  shall make sure that person is expelled.”   <PER>Harry</PER> arranged his face into what he hoped was a  puzzled expression.
“He knew it was me,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as  they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
“<PER>Snape</PER> can’t prove it was you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> reassuringly  to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What can he do?”   “Knowing <PER>Snape</PER>, something foul,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the  potion frothed and bubbled.
A week later, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were walking  across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot  of people gathered around the notice board, reading a  piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.
“Could be useful,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as  they went into dinner.
“Shall we go?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were all for it, so at eight o’clock  that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall.
“Someone told  me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was  young — maybe it’ll be him.”   “As long as it’s not — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but he ended on  a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the  stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and  accompanied by none other than <PER>Snape</PER>, wearing his  usual black.
Now, I don’t want any  of you youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your  Potions master when I’m through with him, never  fear!”   “Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?”  <PER>Ron</PER> muttered in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why  Lockhart was still smiling; if <PER>Snape</PER> had been looking  at him like that he’d have been running as fast as he  could in the opposite direction.
Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER> turned to face each other and  bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of  his hands, whereas <PER>Snape</PER> jerked his head irritably.
Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”         “I wouldn’t bet on that,” <PER>Harry</PER> murmured, watching  <PER>Snape</PER> baring his teeth.
“Who cares?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
Lockhart teamed <PER>Neville</PER> with Justin Finch-  Fletchley, but <PER>Snape</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> first.
Potter     <PER>Harry</PER> moved automatically toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And bow!”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> barely inclined their heads, not  taking their eyes off each other.
three — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> swung his wand high, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> had already  started on “two”: His spell hit <PER>Harry</PER> so hard he felt as  though he’d been hit over the head with a saucepan.
He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be  working, and wasting no more time, <PER>Harry</PER> pointed his  wand straight at <PER>Malfoy</PER> and shouted, “Rictusempral”   A jet of silver light hit <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the stomach and he  doubled up, wheezing.
“I said disarm only\” Lockhart shouted in alarm over  the heads of the battling crowd, as <PER>Malfoy</PER> sank to his  knees; <PER>Harry</PER> had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and  he could barely move for laughing.
<PER>Harry</PER> hung back,  with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch  <PER>Malfoy</PER> while he was on the floor, but this was a  mistake; gasping for breath, <PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed his wand  at <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the  next second <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs began to jerk around out of  his control in a kind of quickstep.
“Finite Incantatem\” he shouted; <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet stopped  dancing, <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped laughing, and they were able  to look up.
Both <PER>Neville</PER> and Justin were lying on the floor,  panting; <PER>Ron</PER> was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus,  apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done;  but <PER>Hermione</PER> and Millicent Bulstrode were still  moving; Millicent had <PER>Hermione</PER> in a headlock and  <PER>Hermione</PER> was whimpering in pain; both their wands  lay forgotten on the floor.
“How about <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Potter?”  said <PER>Snape</PER> with a twisted smile.
“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Malfoy</PER> into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed  away to give them room.
<PER>Snape</PER> smirked  as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops —  my wand is a little overexcited — ”   <PER>Snape</PER> moved closer to <PER>Malfoy</PER>, bent down, and  whispered something in his ear.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up nervously at Lockhart and said,  “Professor, could you show me that blocking thing  again?”   “Scared?” muttered <PER>Malfoy</PER>, so that Lockhart couldn’t  hear him.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> lazily, clearly  enjoying the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> standing motionless, eye  to eye with the angry snake.
<PER>Snape</PER>, too, was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> in an unexpected  way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and <PER>Harry</PER>  didn’t like it.
“Move — come  on—”     <PER>Ron</PER> steered him out of the hall, <PER>Hermione</PER> hurrying  alongside them.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a  clue what was going on, and neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor  <PER>Hermione</PER> explained anything until they had dragged  him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common  room.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER> into an armchair and  said, “You’re a Parselmouth.
I accidentally set a boa  constrictor on my cousin <PER>Dudley</PER> at the zoo once —  long story — but it was telling me it had never seen  Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to —  that was before I knew I was a wizard — ”   “A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?”  <PER>Ron</PER> repeated faintly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, this is bad.”   “What’s bad?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, starting to feel quite angry.
<PER>Harry</PER> fretted about this next to the fire in the  Gryffindor common room, while <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.
“For heaven’s sake, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  exasperated, as one of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bishops wrestled her  knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.
“It’s not possible to live with the <PER>Dursley</PER>s and not  hate them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, hello, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking up.
As  the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless  Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:   “Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,         You’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun — ”     “That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with  his tongue out at <PER>Harry</PER>.
This  left <PER>Harry</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> alone together.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, “I swear I didn’t — ”   “This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> curtly.
As he and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  stepped onto it, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the wall thud closed  behind them.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told  <PER>Harry</PER> to wait and left him there, alone.
One thing was certain: of all the  teachers’ offices <PER>Harry</PER> had visited so far this year,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s was by far the most interesting.
Then a  small voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter?”   “Er, yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
But I stand by what I  said before” — <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt — “you would have  done well in Slytherin — ”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach plummeted.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it looked very ill. Its eyes         were dull and, even as <PER>Harry</PER> watched, a couple more  feathers fell out of its tail.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just thinking that all he needed was for  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s pet bird to die while he was alone in  the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.
“Your bird — I couldn’t do  anything — he just caught fire — ”   To <PER>Harry</PER>’s astonishment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled.
They can carry immensely  heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and  they make highly faithful pets.”   In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, <PER>Harry</PER> had  forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back  to him as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> settled himself in the high  chair behind the desk and fixed <PER>Harry</PER> with his  penetrating, light-blue stare.
Before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could speak another word,  however, the door of the office flew open with an  almighty bang and <PER>Hagrid</PER> burst in, a wild look in his  eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black  head and the dead rooster still swinging from his  hand.
“It wasn’ <PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  urgently.
“I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that  kid was found, he never had time, sir — ”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tried to say something, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> went  ranting on, waving the rooster around in his  agitation, sending feathers everywhere.
“ — it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the  Ministry o’ Magic if I have to — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, I — ”   “ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know <PER>Harry</PER> never     “<PER>Hagrid</PER>l” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly.
“I do not think that  <PER>Harry</PER> attacked those people.”   “Oh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the rooster falling limply at his  side.
“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” <PER>Harry</PER>  repeated hopefully as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> brushed rooster  feathers off his desk.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though his face  was somber again.
“But I still want to talk to you.”   <PER>Harry</PER> waited nervously while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered  him, the tips of his long fingers together.
“At this rate, well be the only ones left,” <PER>Ron</PER> told  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked <PER>Harry</PER>  loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when  George pretended to ward <PER>Harry</PER> off with a large clove  of garlic when they met.
But their antics  seemed to be aggravating <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who looked  increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.
<PER>Harry</PER>  found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed  the fact that he, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the Weasleys had the  run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play  Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and  practice dueling in private.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER>, the only ones left in their dormitory, were  woken very early by <PER>Hermione</PER>, who burst in, fully  dressed and carrying presents for them both.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — you’re not supposed to be in here — ”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, shielding his eyes against the light.
“Are you sure?”   “Positive,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shirting Scabbers the rat so  that she could sit down on the end of <PER>Ron</PER>’s four-  poster.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had sent him a large tin of treacle  toffee, which <PER>Harry</PER> decided to soften by the fire before  eating; <PER>Ron</PER> had given him a book called Flying with  the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his  favorite Quidditch team, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had bought  him a luxury eagle-feather quill.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> led them in a few of  his favorite carols, <PER>Hagrid</PER> booming more and more  loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.
<PER>Harry</PER>  didn’t even care that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was making loud,  snide remarks about his new sweater from the  Slytherin table.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had barely finished their third  helpings of Christmas pudding when <PER>Hermione</PER>  ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for  the evening.
“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly,  ignoring <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s stupefied faces.
Once      they’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide  them in a broom closet.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked incredulously at each other.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I don’t think — ”   “That could go seriously wrong — ”   But <PER>Hermione</PER> had a steely glint in her eye not unlike  the one Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sometimes had.
“You do want to  investigate <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t you?”   “Oh, all right, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just  have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back.”   When <PER>Hermione</PER> had bustled off to check on the  Polyjuice Potion again, <PER>Ron</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> with a  doom-laden expression.
“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things  could go wrong?”   But to <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s utter amazement, stage one  of the operation went just as smoothly as <PER>Hermione</PER>  had said.
When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle  coming out of the Great Hall, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hid  quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
Once they were safely stowed among  the buckets and mops, <PER>Harry</PER> yanked out a couple of  the bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and <PER>Ron</PER>  pulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs.
Pulling their robes up over their faces,  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> knocked softly on the door.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>?”   They heard the scrape of the lock and <PER>Hermione</PER>  emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and  <PER>Ron</PER> put Crabbe’s into the last one.
“Hang on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> reached  for their glasses.
“Ready,” came <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voices.
I only hope we can find someone to follow ...”   <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been gazing at <PER>Harry</PER>, said, “You don’t  know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He  banged on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s door.
You two hurry  up, you’re wasting time — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, bewildered.
“That’s how he  looks every time a teacher asks him a question.”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, are you okay?” said <PER>Harry</PER> through the  door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> opened the door of the bathroom  carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set  off.
“Don’t swing your arms like that,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to  <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried down the stone steps into the  darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly  as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling  that this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had  hoped.
Nothing’s about to attack me.”   A voice suddenly echoed behind <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was strolling toward them, and for the  first time in his life, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see him.
“I don’t like your attitude!”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneered and motioned for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to  follow him.
He and <PER>Ron</PER>  hurried after <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who said as they turned into the  next passage, “That Peter Weasley — ”   “Percy,” <PER>Ron</PER> corrected him automatically.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  exchanged excited looks.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> marched through it, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  followed him.
“Wait here,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, motioning  them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire.
“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ”         Wondering what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was going to show them,  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down, doing their best to look at  home.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER>'s eyes widen in shock.
“Well?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> impatiently as <PER>Harry</PER> handed the  clipping back to him.
Can I lick your shoes, please,  Potter?’ ”   He dropped his hands and looked at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’s the matter with you two?”         Far too late, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> forced themselves to  laugh, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe  and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.
And people think he’s Slytherin’s  heir!”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited with bated breath: <PER>Malfoy</PER> was  surely seconds away from telling them it was him —  but then —   “I wish I knew who it is,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> petulantly.
Fortunately, <PER>Malfoy</PER> didn’t notice,  and <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking fast, said, “You must have some  idea who’s behind it all.
Feeling  that it would be a bit of a giveaway if <PER>Ron</PER> punched  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> shot him a warning look and said,  “D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber  last time was caught?”       “Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,” said  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
His nose was also  slowly lengthening — their hour was up, <PER>Ron</PER> was  turning back into himself, and from the look of horror  he was suddenly giving <PER>Harry</PER>, he must be, too.
“Medicine for my stomach,” <PER>Ron</PER> grunted, and without  further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin  common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall,  and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that       <PER>Malfoy</PER> hadn’t noticed anything.
“I  know we still haven’t found out who’s doing the  attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and  tell him to check under the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’ drawing room.”   <PER>Harry</PER> checked his face in the cracked mirror.
He put his glasses on as <PER>Ron</PER>  hammered on the door of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s stall.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ”   “Go away!” <PER>Hermione</PER> squeaked.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
“Have you still got  Millicent’s nose or something?”       <PER>Hermione</PER> let her robes fall and <PER>Ron</PER> backed into the  sink.
“It’s okay, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went to visit her every evening.
“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, tipping a stack of books onto <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  bedside table one evening.
“Don’t be silly, <PER>Ron</PER>, I’ve got to keep up,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly.
“I was so sure it was <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, for about the  hundredth time.
“What’s that?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing to something  gold sticking out from under <PER>Hermione</PER>’s pillow.
“Just a get well card,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, trying to  poke it out of sight, but <PER>Ron</PER> was too quick for her.
He  pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:   “To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from  your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart,  Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the  Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of  Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Hermione</PER>, disgusted.
“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or  what?” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> as they left the infirmary  and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Snape</PER> had given them so much homework, <PER>Harry</PER>  thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he  finished it.
<PER>Ron</PER> was just saying he wished he had  asked <PER>Hermione</PER> how many rat tails you were  supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an      angry outburst from the floor above reached their  ears.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked under the sink where Myrtle  was pointing.
<PER>Harry</PER> stepped forward to pick it up,  but <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.
“Hang on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had approached cautiously  and was looking over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”   But <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from the arrested look on  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face that she was thinking what he was  thinking.
“That’s what <PER>Malfoy</PER> said.”   “Yeah ...” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“So?”   “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, wake up,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
His diary would  probably tell us everything — where the Chamber is,      and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in  it — the person who’s behind the attacks this time  wouldn’t want that lying around, would they?”   “That’s a brilliant theory, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “with  just one tiny little flaw.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to find out more  about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the  trophy room to examine Riddle’s special award,  accompanied by an interested <PER>Hermione</PER> and a  thoroughly unconvinced <PER>Ron</PER>, who told them he’d  seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.
<PER>Harry</PER> overheard him telling  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> so while the Gryffindors were  lining up for Transfiguration.
<PER>Harry</PER> went over to the       Gryffindor table, where <PER>Ron</PER> was sitting looking  sickened, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have been  overcome with giggles.
From where he sat, <PER>Harry</PER> could  see a muscle going in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s cheek.
“Please, <PER>Hermione</PER>, tell me you weren’t one of the  forty-six,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they left the Great Hall for their  first lesson.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine  in front of a line of first years, which happened to  include <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to escape.
“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice  of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> started stuffing everything  feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away  before <PER>Malfoy</PER> could hear his musical valentine.
“And you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ”         <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing over, saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> stoop and snatch up  something.
“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  who obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover  and thought he had <PER>Harry</PER>’s own diary.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was staring from the diary  to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking terrified.
“When I’ve had a look,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, waving the diary  tauntingly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
He pulled out his wand and shouted,   “ ExpelliarmusV’ and just as <PER>Snape</PER> had disarmed  Lockhart, so <PER>Malfoy</PER> found the diary shooting out of  his hand into the air.
I’ll have to report this, you know!”   But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t care, he was one-up on <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and  that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was looking furious, and as <PER>Ginny</PER> passed him  to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her,   “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!”   <PER>Ginny</PER> covered her face with her hands and ran into  class.
Snarling, <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his wand, too, but  <PER>Harry</PER> pulled him away.
He  tried to point this out to <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was having  trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles  were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much  interested in anything else.
Excited, <PER>Harry</PER> loaded up his quill a second  time and wrote, “My name is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”   The words shone momentarily on the page and they,  too, sank without trace.
This circular  room with the sleeping portraits was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  office — but it wasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> who was sitting  behind the desk.
This was       Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this  unknown wizard was headmaster, not <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was little more than a phantom,  completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it was the same sort of “no” that  he himself had given <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Well, hurry off to bed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, giving  Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare <PER>Harry</PER>  knew so well.
But to <PER>Harry</PER>’s disappointment, Riddle led him not  into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to  the very dungeon in which <PER>Harry</PER> had Potions with  <PER>Snape</PER>.
“It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> opened the Chamber of  Secrets fifty years ago.”           CORNELIUS FUDGE   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had always known that  <PER>Hagrid</PER> had an unfortunate liking for large and  monstrous creatures.
During their first year at  Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little  wooden house, and it would be a long time before  they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d  christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had heard  that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle,  <PER>Harry</PER> was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a  glimpse of it.
He’d probably thought it was a shame  that the monster had been cooped up so long, and  thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many  legs; <PER>Harry</PER> could just imagine the thirteen-year-old  <PER>Hagrid</PER> trying to fit a leash and collar on it.
Again and again <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  made him recount what he’d seen, until he was  heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long,  circular conversations that followed.
“We always knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been expelled,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> miserably.
“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to  squeal on <PER>Hagrid</PER>, anyway?”   “But the monster had killed someone, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
...”   “You met <PER>Hagrid</PER> down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Do you think we should go and ask <PER>Hagrid</PER> about it  all?”         “That’d be a cheerful visit,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It could affect our whole future,” she told <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking  them with checks.
Play to your  strengths, <PER>Harry</PER>.”       But the only thing <PER>Harry</PER> felt he was really good at  was Quidditch.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ”   Watching <PER>Harry</PER> fearfully, <PER>Neville</PER> pushed open the  door.
As he and  <PER>Neville</PER> pulled the blankets back onto his bed, <PER>Ron</PER>,  Dean, and Seamus came in.
“What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
But <PER>Ron</PER> was examining <PER>Harry</PER>’s  robes.
“What?”   <PER>Harry</PER> jerked his head toward the dormitory door and  <PER>Ron</PER> followed him out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, buck up  there, you need a decent breakfast.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had been staring down the packed Gryffindor  table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle’s diary  was right in front of his eyes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had been  urging him to report the robbery, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like  the idea.
As he left the Great Hall with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to go  and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious  worry was added to <PER>Harry</PER>’s growing list.
He had just  set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet  again —   “ Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear ...”   He shouted aloud and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both  jumped away from him in alarm.
“But why’s she got to go to the library?”   “Because that’s what <PER>Hermione</PER> does,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  shrugging.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just mounting his broom when Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> came half marching, half running across  the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.
...”   Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this  time, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> detach himself from the  complaining crowd; he came running up to them as  they set off toward the castle.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise,  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> didn’t object.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> back into the school and up the marble  staircase.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> pushed the door open and he and <PER>Ron</PER>  entered.
And on the bed next to  her was —       “<PER>Hermione</PER>Y’ <PER>Ron</PER> groaned.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shook their heads, both staring at  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What’re we going to do?” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  ear.
“D’you think they suspect <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   “We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making  up his mind.
“I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if  he set the monster loose last time he’ll know how to  get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.”   “But <PER>McGonagall</PER> said we’ve got to stay in our tower  unless we’re in class — ”         “I think,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more quietly still, “it’s time to  get my dad’s old cloak out again.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had inherited just one thing from his father: a  long and silvery Invisibility Cloak.
Their  Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise,  and there was a particularly tense moment when <PER>Ron</PER>  stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where <PER>Snape</PER>  stood standing guard.
Thankfully, <PER>Snape</PER> sneezed at  almost exactly the moment <PER>Ron</PER> swore.
“Are you okay, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Did you hear  about <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, a slight break in  his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the  Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated  into a corner.
“Good evening, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   It was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Cornelius Fudge,  the Minister of Magic!”   <PER>Harry</PER> elbowed <PER>Ron</PER> hard to make him shut up.
Ministry’s got to act.”   “I never,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking imploringly at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You know I never, Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sir — ”   “I want it understood, Cornelius, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> has my  full confidence,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, frowning at Fudge.
Ministry’s got to do something  — the school governors have been in touch — ”   “Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking <PER>Hagrid</PER>  away will not help in the slightest,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Mr. Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> strode into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, swathed  in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and  satisfied smile.
“ Dreadful thing, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> lazily,  taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the  governors feel it’s time for you to step aside.
At this rate, there’ll be  no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know  what an awful loss that would be to the school.”   “Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking  alarmed, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> suspended — no, no — last  thing we want just now — ”   “The appointment — or suspension — of the  headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,”  said Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> smoothly.
“And as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has  failed to stop these attacks — ”   “See here, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> can’t stop them,”  said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I  mean to say, who can?”   “That remains to be seen,” said Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> with a  nasty smile.
“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead  you into trouble one of these days, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Mr.  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
They won’t like it at all.”   “Yeh can’ take <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, making  Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his       basket.
There’ll be killin’ next!”   “Calm yourself, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not taken his bright blue eyes off  Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s cold gray ones.
You will also find  that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those  who ask for it.”   For a second, <PER>Harry</PER> was almost sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  eyes flickered toward the corner where he and <PER>Ron</PER>  stood hidden.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler,  waited for <PER>Hagrid</PER> to go ahead of him, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>  stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said  carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff,  all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders.
But with no <PER>Hagrid</PER> visible from the  castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his  heels, the scene didn’t look right to <PER>Harry</PER>; no better,  in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things  were so horribly wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had tried to visit <PER>Hermione</PER>, but  visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.
<PER>Harry</PER> constantly repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s final words  to himself.
<PER>Harry</PER>  looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)  by <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was strutting around the school as  though he had just been appointed Head Boy.
<PER>Harry</PER>  didn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the  Potions lesson about two weeks after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and  <PER>Hagrid</PER> had left, when, sitting right behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  <PER>Harry</PER> overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
...”       <PER>Snape</PER> swept past <PER>Harry</PER>, making no comment about  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s empty seat and cauldron.
“Sir, why don’t you apply for  the headmaster’s job?”   “Now, now, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, though he couldn’t  suppress a thin-lipped smile.
Pity it wasn’t Granger — ”   The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s last words, <PER>Ron</PER> had leapt off his stool, and in  the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts  to reach <PER>Malfoy</PER> went unnoticed.
“Let me at him,” <PER>Ron</PER> growled as <PER>Harry</PER> and Dean  hung onto his arms.
“I don’t care, I don’t need my  wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ”   “Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,”  barked <PER>Snape</PER> over the class’s heads, and off they  marched, with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Dean bringing up the  rear, <PER>Ron</PER> still trying to get loose.
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the  same Shrivelfig as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> character,” said Ernie, breaking  off dead twigs, “he seems very pleased about all this,  doesn’t he?
D’you know, I think he might be  Slytherin’s heir.”   “That’s clever of you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who didn’t seem to  have forgiven Ernie as readily as <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do you think it’s <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Ernie asked.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit  <PER>Ron</PER> over the hand with his pruning shears.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> lagged behind the others so they could  talk out of earshot.
“Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” <PER>Harry</PER>  told <PER>Ron</PER>.
He’s used to  going into the forest with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he might be some  help.”   “Right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was twirling his wand  nervously in his fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER> started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow,  but stopped in midsentence when <PER>Harry</PER> kicked him  hard under the desk.
But Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that  he had always thought <PER>Hagrid</PER> was no good, his  confidence that the whole business was now at an  end, irritated <PER>Harry</PER> so much that he yearned to throw  Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face.
Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to  <PER>Ron</PER>: Let’s do it tonight   <PER>Ron</PER> read the message, swallowed hard, and looked  sideways at the empty seat usually filled by  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Fred and George  challenged <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to a few games of  Exploding Snap, and <PER>Ginny</PER> sat watching them, very  subdued in <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s usual chair.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games  quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when  Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> finally went to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited for the distant sounds of two  dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak,       throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the  portrait hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> left the Invisibility Cloak on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s table.
...”       <PER>Harry</PER> tapped <PER>Ron</PER> on the shoulder, pointing at the  grass.
Something wet touched <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and he jumped  backward, crushing <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, but it was only Fang’s  nose.
“What d’you reckon?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, whose eyes  he could just make out, reflecting the light from his  wand.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark,  making both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jump out of their skins.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, looking around into the  pitch-dark, and gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow very hard.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, his voice breaking with relief.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it’s our car!”   “What?”   “Come on!”   <PER>Harry</PER> blundered after <PER>Ron</PER> toward the light, stumbling  and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged  into a clearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could  hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third  monster, whining loudly, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have  yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left  his voice back with the car in the clearing.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked exactly like <PER>Harry</PER> felt.
“We’re friends of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s,” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s in trouble,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, breathing very fast.
They thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER> had  opened the Chamber and set me free.”   “And you ... you didn’t come from the Chamber of  Secrets?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who could feel cold sweat on his  forehead.
Well  do I remember how I pleaded with <PER>Hagrid</PER> to let me go,  when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”   “What is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently.
I never even told <PER>Hagrid</PER> the name of that  dread creature, though he asked me, many times.”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to press the subject, not with the  spiders pressing closer on all sides.
He was backing slowly into his  domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch  slowly toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
Good-bye,  friend of <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”       <PER>Harry</PER> spun around.
The car screeched  to a halt in front of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and the doors flew  open.
“Get Fang!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, diving into the front seat;   <PER>Ron</PER> seized the boarhound around the middle and  threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the  doors slammed shut — <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t touch the  accelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine  roared and they were off, hitting more spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Fang flung himself at the window in  his anxiety to get out, and when <PER>Harry</PER> opened the  door, he shot off through the trees to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house,  tail between his legs.
<PER>Harry</PER> got out too, and after a  minute or so, <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to regain the feeling in his  limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin to get the  Invisibility Cloak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> got outside again,  he found <PER>Ron</PER> being violently sick in the pumpkin  patch.
“That’s exactly <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s problem!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping  the wall of the cabin.
What have we found out, I’d like to  know?”   “That <PER>Hagrid</PER> never opened the Chamber of Secrets,”  said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing the cloak over <PER>Ron</PER> and prodding  him in the arm to make him walk.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” he hissed through the dark, “<PER>Ron</PER> — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly  around, and saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
Aragog said she was found  in a bathroom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring <PER>Neville</PER>’s  snuffling snores from the corner.
“We’re still  getting exams?”        There was a loud bang behind <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Neville</PER>  Longbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs  on his desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over  at the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to  see that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> hadn’t joined in.
It might be kinder to  leave her where she is till they’re over.”   Just then, <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley came over and sat down  next to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down  the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face  that reminded <PER>Harry</PER> of someone, though he couldn’t  think who.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized who <PER>Ginny</PER> looked like.
“I’ve got to tell you something,” <PER>Ginny</PER> mumbled,  carefully not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only  <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could hear him.
“Pass me those rolls, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m starving.”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew the whole mystery might be solved  tomorrow without their help, but he wasn’t about to  pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up —  and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were  being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.
“The first words out of those poor Petrified  people’s mouths will be ‘It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.’ Frankly, I’m  astounded Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> thinks all these  security measures are necessary.”   “I agree, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making <PER>Ron</PER> drop his books  in surprise.
“We were  going to — to go and see — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> both looked at him.
“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> went  on hurriedly, treading on <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, “and we thought  we’d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell  her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to  worry — ”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was still staring at him, and for  a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought she was going to explode,  but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky  voice.
Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given  my permission.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked away, hardly daring to believe  that they’d avoided detention.
“That,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fervently, “was the best story you’ve  ever come up with.”   They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing  and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s permission to visit <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, looking sadly at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s rigid face.
...”   But <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>’s face.
“Try and get it out,” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, shifting his chair  so that he blocked <PER>Harry</PER> from Madam Pomfrey’s view.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand was clamped so  tightly around the paper that <PER>Harry</PER> was sure he was  going to tear it.
<PER>Harry</PER>  smoothed it out eagerly and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned close to read  it, too.
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in  a hand <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
Someone would’ve  seen ...”   <PER>Harry</PER>, however, pointed at the word <PER>Hermione</PER> had  scribbled at the foot of the page.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“Should we go straight to <PER>McGonagall</PER>?”   “Let’s go to the staffroom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jumping up.
<PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> paced around it, too excited to sit down.
Immediately,  please.”   <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled around to stare at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> gripped the  back of a chair very hard and said, “How can you be  sure?”   “The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  who was very white, “left another message.
“Which student?”   “<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> slide silently down onto the wardrobe  floor beside him.
For one wild  moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it would be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I don’t recall — ”   “I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you  hadn’t had a crack at the monster before <PER>Hagrid</PER> was  arrested,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“She knew something, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, speaking for  the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in  the staffroom.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, shaking his head  impatiently, “it’s not nearly as simple as that.
Lockhart had  barely raised his, when <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed,   “ Expelliarmus\ ”   Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his  trunk; his wand flew high into the air; <PER>Ron</PER> caught it,  and flung it out of the open window.
“Shouldn’t have let Professor <PER>Snape</PER> teach us that  one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk  aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried over to it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> gasp and looked up again.
“I’ll just — ”   He put his hand on the door knob, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>  both pointed their wands at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood aside as <PER>Ron</PER> came  whizzing out of the pipe, too.
Trying  very hard not to imagine what <PER>Ginny</PER> might look like if  they found her, <PER>Harry</PER> led the way forward, around a  dark bend in the tunnel.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — there’s something up there — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>  hoarsely, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was  straightening up, panting, <PER>Ron</PER>’s wand in his hand  and a gleaming smile back on his face.
<PER>Ron</PER>!”   “I’m here!” came <PER>Ron</PER>’s muffled voice from behind the  rock-fall.
And, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “See you in a bit,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to inject some  confidence into his shaking voice.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>l” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, sprinting to her and  dropping to his knees.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — don’t be dead —  please don’t be dead — ” He flung his wand aside,  grabbed <PER>Ginny</PER>’s shoulders, and turned her over.
But then she  must be —   “<PER>Ginny</PER>, please wake up,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered desperately,  shaking her.
“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, raising  <PER>Ginny</PER>’s head again.
<PER>Harry</PER>, sweating, managed to hoist  <PER>Ginny</PER> half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand  again.
“Listen,” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently, his knees sagging with  <PER>Ginny</PER>’s dead weight.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Ginny</PER> back onto the floor, unable to  hold her up any longer.
I suppose the real  reason <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley’s like this is because she         opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an  invisible stranger.”   “What are you talking about?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Little <PER>Ginny</PER>’s been  writing in it for months and months, telling me all her  pitiful worries and woes — how her brothers tease  her, how she had to come to school with secondhand  robes and books, how” — Riddle’s eyes glinted —   “how she didn’t think famous, good, great <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter would ever like her.
“Well, you see, <PER>Ginny</PER> told me all about you, <PER>Harry</PER>,”  said Riddle.
So I decided to show you my famous capture of that  great oaf, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, to gain your trust — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s my friend,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice now  shaking.
“It was my word against <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Only the Transfiguration teacher, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  seemed to think <PER>Hagrid</PER> was innocent.
...”       “I bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> saw right through you,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, his teeth gritted.
I have many questions for you,  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”   “Like what?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat, fists still clenched.
...”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present,  and future, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
No,  <PER>Harry</PER> — I fashioned myself a new name, a name I  knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to  speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the  world!”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain seemed to have jammed.
but the longer Riddle stood  there, the more life was dwindling out of <PER>Ginny</PER> ... and  in the meantime, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed suddenly, Riddle’s  outline was becoming clearer, more solid.
Let’s match the powers of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, Heir of  Salazar Slytherin, against famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, and  the best weapons <PER>Dumbledore</PER> can give him.
Eyes still tightly shut, <PER>Harry</PER> began to run  blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his  way — <PER>Voldemort</PER> was laughing —   <PER>Harry</PER> tripped.
The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing  <PER>Harry</PER>, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could shut his eyes, it turned   — <PER>Harry</PER> looked straight into its face and saw that its  eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been  punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the  floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.
He raised the sword in both his  hands —   The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was  true — <PER>Harry</PER> threw his whole weight behind the  sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the  serpent’s mouth —   But as warm blood drenched <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms, he felt a  searing pain just above his elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER>  gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes,  still resting his head on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — I tried to tell you at b-  breakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it  was me, <PER>Harry</PER> — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to  — R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over — and —  how did you kill that — that thing?
The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the  diary — ”         “It’s all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, holding up the diary, and  showing <PER>Ginny</PER> the fang hole, “Riddle’s finished.
C’mon, <PER>Ginny</PER>, let’s get out of  here — ”   “I’m going to be expelled!” <PER>Ginny</PER> wept as <PER>Harry</PER> helped  her awkwardly to her feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> urged <PER>Ginny</PER> forward; they  stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk,  through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, speeding up.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>\” <PER>Ron</PER> thrust an arm through the gap in the  rock to pull her through first.
“He’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, squeezing through  himself.
“How come you’ve got a sword?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gaping at  the glittering weapon in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with  a sideways glance at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was crying harder  than ever.
He didn’t think it was a  good idea to tell <PER>Ron</PER> yet who’d been opening the  Chamber, not in front of <PER>Ginny</PER>, anyway.
Do  you live here?”   “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, raising his eyebrows at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had  swooped past <PER>Harry</PER> and was now fluttering in front of  him, his beady eyes bright in the dark.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, grab <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“You hold <PER>Ginny</PER>’s other hand — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his  belt, <PER>Ron</PER> took hold of the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, and  <PER>Harry</PER> reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s  strangely hot tail feathers.
You’ve got competition,  <PER>Ginny</PER>!”   But tears were still flooding silently down <PER>Ginny</PER>’s  face.
“Where now?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, with an anxious look at  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
DOBBY’S REWARD   For a moment there was silence as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,   <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in  muck and slime and (in <PER>Harry</PER>’s case) blood.
Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing by the mantelpiece,  beaming, next to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who was  taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest.
Fawkes went whooshing past <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear and settled  on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s shoulder, just as <PER>Harry</PER> found  himself and <PER>Ron</PER> being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight  embrace.
For nearly a  quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He  told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how  <PER>Hermione</PER> had finally realized that he was hearing a  basilisk in the pipes; how he and <PER>Ron</PER> had followed  the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them  where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he  had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the  victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of  Secrets might be in her bathroom.
...   “Very well,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> prompted him as  he paused, “so you found out where the entrance was  — breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along  the way, I might add — but how on earth did you all  get out of there alive, Potter?”   So <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice now growing hoarse from all this  talking, told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and  about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword.
Instinctively, <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who  smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon  spectacles.
“What interests me most,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently, “is  how Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> managed to enchant <PER>Ginny</PER>,  when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in  the forests of Albania.”   Relief — warm, sweeping, glorious relief — swept over  <PER>Harry</PER>.
But <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s not  ... <PER>Ginny</PER> hasn’t been ... has she?”   “It was this diary,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, picking it up  and showing it to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took the diary from <PER>Harry</PER> and peered  keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and  soggy pages.
Hardly anyone  connected Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> with the clever, handsome  boy who was once Head Boy here.”   “But, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said Mrs. Weasley.
“What’s our <PER>Ginny</PER>  got to do with — with — him?”         “His d-diary!” <PER>Ginny</PER> sobbed.
She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I  daresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any  moment.”   “So <PER>Hermione</PER>’s okay!” said <PER>Ron</PER> brightly.
“There has been no lasting harm done, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You know, Minerva,” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said  thoughtfully to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “I think all this  merits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert  the kitchens?”       “Right,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> crisply, also  moving to the door.
She left, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> gazed uncertainly at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> said quickly, “there was  an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets.
I expect I was hopeless, was I?”   “He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand  backfired,” <PER>Ron</PER> explained quietly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“He’ll  lend you one.”   “Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the  infirmary, too?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> cast a curious look back at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> as he closed the door.
“Sit down, <PER>Harry</PER>,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat, feeling  unaccountably nervous.
“First of all, <PER>Harry</PER>, I want to thank you,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, eyes twinkling again.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned awkwardly as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched him.
...”   “ Did he, now?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking thoughtfully  at <PER>Harry</PER> from under his thick silver eyebrows.
“And  what do you think, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I don’t think I’m like him!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more loudly  than he’d intended.
...”   “You can speak Parseltongue, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly, “because Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> — who  is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin  — can speak Parseltongue.
...”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER> put a bit of himself in me?” <PER>Harry</PER> said,  thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”         “So I should be in Slytherin,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking  desperately into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
It  is our choices, <PER>Harry</PER>, that show what we truly are, far  more than our abilities.” <PER>Harry</PER> sat motionless in his  chair, stunned.
“If you want proof, <PER>Harry</PER>, that you  belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely  at this.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached across to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s  desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and  handed it to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of  the hat, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
Then  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pulled open one of the drawers in         Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk and took out a quill and  a bottle of ink.
Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> almost knocked <PER>Harry</PER> over as he swept  into the room.
His great eyes  fixed meaningfully on <PER>Harry</PER>, he kept pointing at the  diary, then at Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and then hitting himself  hard on the head with his fist.
“I see ...” said Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> slowly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“A clever plan,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a level voice, still  staring Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> straight in the eye.
“Because if       <PER>Harry</PER> here” — Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER> a swift, sharp  look — “and his friend <PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t discovered this  book, why — <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley might have taken all the  blame.
“Don’t you want to know how <PER>Ginny</PER> got hold of that  diary, Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  smiling at <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”   Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> stood for a moment, and <PER>Harry</PER>  distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was  longing to reach for his wand.
“Can I give  that diary back to Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>, please?”   “Certainly, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got  something for you — ”   And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  hand.
“What the — ?”   Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> ripped the sock off the diary, threw it  aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”   But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter!”   There was a loud bang, and Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> was thrown  backward.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing  up at <PER>Harry</PER>, moonlight from the nearest window  reflected in his orb-like eyes.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter set Dobby  free!”   “Least I could do, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as  Dobby pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>’s sock with shaking hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know  whether the best bit was <PER>Hermione</PER> running toward  him, screaming “You solved it!
You solved it!” or  Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to  wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting  him, or <PER>Hagrid</PER> turning up at half past three, cuffing  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> so hard on the shoulders that they  were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the  House Cup for the second year running, or Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> standing up to tell them all that the  exams had been canceled as a school treat (“Oh, no!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>), or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> announcing that,  unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to  return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to  go away and get his memory back.
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a  few, small differences — Defense Against the Dark  Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of  practice at that anyway,” <PER>Ron</PER> told a disgruntled  <PER>Hermione</PER>) and Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been sacked as a  school governor.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred,  George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> got a compartment to themselves.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t  want you to tell anyone?”   “Oh, that,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, giggling.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and  turned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The <PER>Dursley</PER> family of number four, Privet Drive, was  the reason that <PER>Harry</PER> never enjoyed his summer  holidays.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son,  <PER>Dudley</PER>, were <PER>Harry</PER>’s only living relatives.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s dead parents, who had been a  witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned  under the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ roof.
One of the  essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking  potions, was for <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite teacher,  Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, who would be delighted to have an  excuse to give <PER>Harry</PER> detention for a month.
While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and  <PER>Dudley</PER> had gone out into the front garden to admire  Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices,  so that the rest of the street would notice it too),   <PER>Harry</PER> had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the  cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his  books, and hidden them in his bedroom.
<PER>Ron</PER> Weasley, who was one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s best friends at  Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards.
“Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> speaking.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, who happened to be in the room at the time,  froze as he heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice answer.
<PER>Ron</PER> obviously realized that he’d gotten <PER>Harry</PER> into  trouble, because he hadn’t called again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s other  best friend from Hogwarts, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, hadn’t  been in touch either.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected that <PER>Ron</PER> had       warned <PER>Hermione</PER> not to call, which was a pity,  because <PER>Hermione</PER>, the cleverest witch in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to  use a telephone, and would probably have had  enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.
It was not, as the  <PER>Dursley</PER>s had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of  the car crash that had killed <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents, because  Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash.
<PER>Harry</PER> had escaped from the same attack  with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s curse, instead of killing him, had  rebounded upon its originator.
Right in the middle of the  picture was <PER>Ron</PER>, tall and gangling, with his pet rat,  Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his  little sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered only too well the occasion when  <PER>Ron</PER>’s old wand had snapped.
Bye —   <PER>Ron</PER>         <PER>Harry</PER> put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside  table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point,  reflecting the luminous hands of his clock.
Dear <PER>Harry</PER>,   <PER>Ron</PER> wrote to me and told me about his phone call to  your Uncle Vernon.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed as he put <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s letter aside and  picked up her present.
“Wow, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, unzipping the  case to look inside.
He knew that <PER>Hagrid</PER> would never send  him anything dangerous on purpose, but then,   <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t have a normal person’s view of what  was dangerous.
Praying that the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were still  fast asleep, <PER>Harry</PER> got down on his hands and knees  and reached toward it.
The Monster Book  shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap,  so <PER>Harry</PER> threw it down on the bed and reached for  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s card.
All the best,   <PER>Hagrid</PER>   It struck <PER>Harry</PER> as ominous that <PER>Hagrid</PER> thought a  biting book would come in useful, but he put <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  card up next to <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, grinning more  broadly than ever.
Yours sincerely,   Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER>  Deputy Headmistress   <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and  looked at it, no longer grinning.
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE   <PER>Harry</PER> went down to breakfast the next morning to  find the three <PER>Dursley</PER>s already sitting around the  kitchen table.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down between <PER>Dudley</PER> and Uncle Vernon, a  large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of  mustache.
Far from wishing <PER>Harry</PER> a happy birthday,  none of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s made any sign that they had  noticed <PER>Harry</PER> enter the room, but <PER>Harry</PER> was far too  used to this to care.
At <PER>Dudley</PER>’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had  whacked <PER>Harry</PER> around the shins with her walking  stick to stop him from beating <PER>Dudley</PER> at musical  statues.
A few years later, she had turned up at  Christmas with a computerized robot for <PER>Dudley</PER> and  a box of dog biscuits for <PER>Harry</PER>.
On her last visit, the  year before <PER>Harry</PER> started at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> had  accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog.
“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled,  “and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat       finger threateningly at <PER>Harry</PER> — “we need to get a few  things straight before I go and collect her.”   <PER>Dudley</PER> smirked and withdrew his gaze from the  television.
Watching <PER>Harry</PER> being bullied by Uncle  Vernon was <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite form of entertainment.
“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil  tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.”   “All right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly, “if she does when she’s  talking to me.”   “Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he  had not heard <PER>Harry</PER>’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know  anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any —  any funny stuff while she’s here.
Want to come  along for the ride, Dudders?”   “No,” said <PER>Dudley</PER>, whose attention had returned to  the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished  threatening <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But if you sign my permission form,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on  quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to  go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal  and everything.”   <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it  over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was  throbbing in his temple.
It’s the only way I’ll  be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note  to <PER>Ron</PER> bound to her leg) soared out of the window  and out of sight.
Aunt Marge thrust the  suitcase into <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach, knocking the wind out  of him, seized <PER>Dudley</PER> in a tight one-armed hug, and  planted a large kiss on his cheek.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that <PER>Dudley</PER> only put up  with Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for  it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, <PER>Dudley</PER>  had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d  been dumped on my doorstep.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an  orphanage than with the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, but the thought of  the Hogsmeade form stopped him.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt  Petunia usually encouraged <PER>Harry</PER> to stay out of their  way, which <PER>Harry</PER> was only too happy to do.
She delighted in  comparing <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Dudley</PER>, and took huge  pleasure in buying <PER>Dudley</PER> expensive presents while  glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though daring him to ask why he  hadn’t got a present too.
He thought of <PER>Ron</PER> and      <PER>Hermione</PER>, and his heart sank even lower.
<PER>Harry</PER> was  sure that, criminal or not, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would  want to help him now, but they were both abroad,  and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting  them.
With a feeling of unease, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Stan’s eyes  move to the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, saying the first  name that came into his head.
This is <PER>Neville</PER>  Longbottom, Ern.”   Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick  glasses, nodded to <PER>Harry</PER>, who nervously flattened his  bangs again and sat down on his bed.
“ ’Course ’e was on  the Muggle news, <PER>Neville</PER>, where you been?”         He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look  on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, removed the front page, and handed  it to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You oughta read the papers more, <PER>Neville</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> held the paper up to the candlelight and read:  BLACK STILL AT LARGE   Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner  ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding  capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.
“What, <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, without thinking.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t soon forget the look of  terror on <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face when he had been told where  he was going, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was one of the bravest  people <PER>Harry</PER> knew.
After a while, Stan  remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> had paid for hot chocolate,  but poured it all over <PER>Harry</PER>’s pillow when the bus      moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen.
“Right then, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said Stan, clapping his hands,  “whereabouts in London?”   “Diagon Alley,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
I can see ’is scar!”   “Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the  Knight Bus picked <PER>Harry</PER> up, but he and I need to  step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...”   Fudge increased the pressure on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder,  and <PER>Harry</PER> found himself being steered inside the pub.
“ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, <PER>Neville</PER>?”  said Stan, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>, while Ernie’s owlish face  peered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.
“Well, I won’t deny that they  are extremely angry, <PER>Harry</PER>, but they are prepared to  take you back next summer as long as you stay at  Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.”   <PER>Harry</PER> unstuck his throat.
“Now, have a crumpet, <PER>Harry</PER>, while I go and see if  Tom’s got a room for you.”   Fudge strode out of the parlor and <PER>Harry</PER> stared after  him.
“No, no, I’m very sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, but as  I’m not your parent or guardian — ”         “But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
Enjoy your stay, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   And with a last smile and shake of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand,  Fudge left the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Drive      only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and  that he was now facing three <PER>Dursley</PER>-free weeks.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have to do  his homework under the blankets by flashlight  anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine  outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor,  finishing all his essays with occasional help from  Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a  great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave <PER>Harry</PER>  free sundaes every half an hour.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> understood why <PER>Hagrid</PER>  had said it would come in useful.
“Come to get your new  books?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I need — ”         “Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently,  brushing <PER>Harry</PER> aside.
... Well ... is there anything else I can help you  with?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down his booklist, “I need  Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.”   “Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager,  stripping off his gloves and leading <PER>Harry</PER> into the  back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to  fortune-telling.
As the days slipped by, <PER>Harry</PER> started looking  wherever he went for a sign of <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> met  Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow  Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where  they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the  real <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy,  outside Flourish and Blotts.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t stop to chat;  <PER>Neville</PER> appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was  being told off by his very formidable-looking  grandmother.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped she never found out that  he’d pretended to be <PER>Neville</PER> while on the run from the  Ministry of Magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking  that he would at least meet <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express.
HARRY!”   They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean  Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — <PER>Ron</PER> looking  incredibly freckly, <PER>Hermione</PER> very brown, both waving  frantically at him.
“Finally!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> as he sat down.
“Did you really blow up your aunt, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> in a very serious voice.
“I didn’t mean to,” said <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> roared with  laughter.
“I just — lost control.”   “It’s not funny, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“Honestly, I’m amazed <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t expelled.”   “So am I,” admitted <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s there as  well!”         <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded, beaming.
The assistant nearly cried when we said we  wanted two.”   “What’s all that, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, pointing at  not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to  her.
“Those are my books for  Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination,  Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — ”   “What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  rolling his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year,  <PER>Hermione</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER> sniggered.
I mean, <PER>Harry</PER>’s got Hedwig and  you’ve got Errol — ”   “I haven’t,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
The  witch behind the counter was already advising a  wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> waited, examining the cages.
Like nearly everything <PER>Ron</PER> owned, Scabbers the rat  was secondhand (he had once belonged to <PER>Ron</PER>’s  brother Percy) and a bit battered.
“Scabbers!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, racing out of the shop after  him; <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, that thing nearly scalped me!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
How’s he going to get it with that thing  around?”   “That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, slapping the small red bottle into <PER>Ron</PER>’s  hand.
“How are  you?”   “Fine, thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, who had always been very taken with <PER>Harry</PER>,  seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual  when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved  her life during their previous year at Hogwarts.
Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as  though he and <PER>Harry</PER> had never met and said, “<PER>Harry</PER>.
Tom the  innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and  the seven Weasleys, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ate their  way through five delicious courses.
“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr.  Weasley, “ — and as I work there, they’re doing me a  favor — ”   His voice was casual, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help noticing  that Mr. Weasley’s ears had gone red, just like <PER>Ron</PER>’s  did when he was under pressure.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Percy  were next door to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to  <PER>Ron</PER>, and he went downstairs.
“You know  what <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> are like, wandering off by  themselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden  Forest!
If Black can  break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.”   “But no one’s really sure that Black’s after <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   There was a thud on wood, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure Mr.  Weasley had banged his fist on the table.
I don’t think  anything could hurt <PER>Harry</PER> at Hogwarts while  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s headmaster.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced a laugh, went to give <PER>Ron</PER> the rat tonic,  then shut himself in his room and lay down on his  bed.
But <PER>Harry</PER>  happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley  that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> happened to be.
Didn’t people always say      that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only person Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>  had ever been afraid of?
Nobody would want <PER>Harry</PER> to leave  the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in  fact, <PER>Harry</PER> suspected his every move would be  carefully watched until the danger had passed.
<PER>Harry</PER> got dressed and  was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back  into her cage when <PER>Ron</PER> banged his way into the  room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking  irritable.
...”   “I’ve got something to tell you,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but they  were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked  in to congratulate <PER>Ron</PER> on infuriating Percy again.
They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley  was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a  furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling      <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> about a love potion she’d made  as a young girl.
“What were you saying?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> as they sat  down.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no chance to speak to <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> in  the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all  their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow  staircase and piling them up near the door, with  Hedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on  top in their cages.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on.”   Mr. Weasley marched <PER>Harry</PER> across the short stretch  of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark  green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-  looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
<PER>Harry</PER> got into the back of the car and was shortly  joined by <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and, to <PER>Ron</PER>’s disgust,   Percy.
I’ll go  through first with <PER>Harry</PER>.”   Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between  platforms nine and ten, pushing <PER>Harry</PER>’s trolley and  apparently very interested in the Intercity 125 that  had just arrived at platform nine.
Percy and <PER>Ginny</PER> suddenly appeared behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye, and  they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy  strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with  his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his  shiny badge.
Once the remaining Weasleys and <PER>Hermione</PER> had  joined them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> led the way to the end of  the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage  that looked quite empty.
Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then <PER>Hermione</PER>,  and finally, <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a  moment.”   He jerked his head toward a pillar, and <PER>Harry</PER> followed  him behind it, leaving the others crowded around  Mrs. Weasley.
This way, you haven’t  broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going  on.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you must be very scared — ”   “I’m not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> sincerely.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, swear  to me you won’t go looking for Black.”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared.
“Promise me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more  quickly still, “that whatever happens — ”   “Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to  kill me?” said <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran to the compartment door and <PER>Ron</PER>  threw it open and stood back to let him on.
“I need to talk to you in private,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the train picked up speed.
“Go away, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off down the corridor,  looking for an empty compartment, but all were full  except for the one at the very end of the train.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  checked on the threshold.
Defense Against the Dark  Arts.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already had two  Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of       whom had lasted only one year.
When he’d finished, <PER>Ron</PER> looked  thunderstruck, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had her hands over her  mouth.
Don’t go looking for trouble,  <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “I don’t go looking for trouble,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, nettled.
“Trouble usually finds me.”   “How thick would <PER>Harry</PER> have to be, to go looking for a  nutter who wants to kill him?” said <PER>Ron</PER> shakily.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be much  more frightened of Black than he was.
“It’s coming from your trunk, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  standing up and reaching into the luggage rack.
“It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to  send it to <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrewdly.
You  know he’s not really up to long journeys ... but how  else was I supposed to get <PER>Harry</PER>’s present to him?”   “Stick it back in the trunk,” <PER>Harry</PER> advised as the  Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him  up.”   He nodded toward Professor Lupin.
“In Sites of Historical  Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the  1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s  supposed to be the most severely haunted building in  Britain — ”   “ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a  few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was plainly not listening to a word  <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s didn’t sign my permission  form, and Fudge wouldn’t either.”         <PER>Ron</PER> looked horrified.
But — no way —  <PER>McGonagall</PER> or someone will give you permission — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> gave a hollow laugh.
“ — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every  secret passage out of the castle — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“I don’t think <PER>Harry</PER>  should be sneaking out of school with Black on the  loose — ”   “Yeah, I expect that’s what <PER>McGonagall</PER> will say when  I ask for permission,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“But if we’re with him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> spiritedly to  <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Black wouldn’t dare — ”   “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Don’t let that thing out!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but too late;  Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched,  yawned, and sprang onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s knees; the lump in  <PER>Ron</PER>’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks  angrily away.
“Get out of here!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, don’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
Crookshanks had now settled in an  empty seat, his squashed face turned toward <PER>Ron</PER>, his  yellow eyes on <PER>Ron</PER>’s top pocket.
“I mean — he  hasn’t died, has he?”   “No, no, he’s breathing,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking  the Cauldron Cake <PER>Harry</PER> passed her.
Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring  the rolling hills outside the window, they heard  footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least  favorite people appeared at the door: <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory  Goyle.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had been enemies ever since  they had met on their very first train journey to  Hogwarts.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had a pale, pointed, sneering  face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the  Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that  <PER>Harry</PER> played on the Gryffindor team.
“New teacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who got to his feet, too, in  case he needed to hold <PER>Ron</PER> back.
“What were you  saying, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?”         <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to  pick a fight right under a teacher’s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down again, <PER>Ron</PER> massaging his  knuckles.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>, pointing at Professor Lupin,  “be careful ...”   But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
“What’s going on?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice from behind  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, that was my foot!”  <PER>Harry</PER> felt his way back to his seat.
“D’you think we’ve broken down?”   “Dunno ...”   There was a squeaking sound, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dim  black outline of <PER>Ron</PER>, wiping a patch clean on the  window and peering out.
— Ouch —  sorry — ”   “Hullo, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling around in the dark  and pulling <PER>Neville</PER> up by his cloak.
“Who’s that?”   “Who’s that?”   “<PER>Ginny</PER>?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “What are you doing?”   “I was looking for <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “Come in and sit down — ”   “Not here!” said <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were kneeling next to  him, and above them he could see <PER>Neville</PER> and  Professor Lupin watching.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> heaved him back onto his seat.
<PER>Ginny</PER>  and <PER>Neville</PER> looked back at him, both very pale.
“Are you sure you’re okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  watching <PER>Harry</PER> anxiously.
...”   <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly  as bad as <PER>Harry</PER> felt, gave a small sob; <PER>Hermione</PER> went  over and put a comforting arm around her.
“No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking anxiously at <PER>Harry</PER> again.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned and saw the gigantic  outline of <PER>Hagrid</PER> at the other end of the platform,  beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward  for their traditional journey across the lake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed the rest of the  school along the platform and out onto a rough mud  track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited  the remaining students, each pulled, <PER>Harry</PER> could only  assume, by an invisible horse, because when they  climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all  by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
<PER>Ron</PER> and       <PER>Hermione</PER> kept looking at him sideways, as though  frightened he might collapse again.
At last, the carriage swayed to a  halt, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got out.
You actually fainted?”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> elbowed past <PER>Hermione</PER> to block <PER>Harry</PER>’s way  up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and  his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
“Shove off, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose jaw was  clenched.
<PER>Hermione</PER> prodded <PER>Ron</PER> in the back to make him  hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd  swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front  doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit  with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent  marble staircase that led to the upper floors.
I want to see you both!”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned around, surprised.
<PER>Harry</PER> fought his way over to  her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  had a way of making him feel he must have done  something wrong.
“Move along there,  Weasley.”   <PER>Ron</PER> stared as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ushered  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> away from the chattering crowd;  they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up  the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a  large, welcoming fire, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> motioned  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to sit down.
The thought of  what <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> would say if he had to go to the  hospital wing was torture.
He had to wait only a few minutes; then  <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged looking very happy about  something, followed by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and the  three of them made their way back down the marble  staircase to the Great Hall.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> strode off toward her empty seat at the  staff table, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off in the  other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the  Gryffindor table.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on either side of <PER>Ron</PER>, who  had saved them seats.
You couldn’t help trusting Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> watched him beaming  around at the students, he felt really calm for the first  time since the dementor had entered the train  compartment.
...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared his throat and continued, “As  you will all be aware after their search of the  Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing  host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are  here on Ministry of Magic business.”   He paused, and <PER>Harry</PER> remembered what Mr. Weasley  had said about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> not being happy with the  dementors guarding the school.
Dementors are not to be fooled  by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks,”  he added blandly, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at each  other.
“Look at <PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
It was  common knowledge that <PER>Snape</PER> wanted the Defense  Against the Dark Arts job, but even <PER>Harry</PER>, who hated  <PER>Snape</PER>, was startled at the expression twisting his  thin, sallow face.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that expression only too well; it was the  look <PER>Snape</PER> wore every time he set eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
However, I  am delighted to say that his place will be filled by  none other than Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who has agreed to  take on this teaching job in addition to his  gamekeeping duties.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at one another,  stunned.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward to see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who  was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his  enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of  his black beard.
“Who else would have assigned us a biting  book?”     <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were the last to stop  clapping, and as Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> started  speaking again, they saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was wiping his  eyes on the tablecloth.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were eager for it to  finish so that they could talk to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
It had been <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> who had cleared <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s name last year.
“Congratulations, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> squealed as they  reached the teachers’ table.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined the Gryffindors  streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired  now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs,  to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES   When <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the Great  Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they  saw was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who seemed to be entertaining  a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.
“Ignore him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was right behind  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s up with you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sitting down on George’s other  side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.
“Gryffindor versus  Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?”   The only time <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> had faced each other  in a Quidditch match, <PER>Malfoy</PER> had definitely come off  worse.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning as he looked over her  shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule.
I’ve fixed it all with Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.”   “But look,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, laughing, “see this morning?
“But — ”   “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?”  <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
“I told you, I’ve fixed it all with  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.”   Just then, <PER>Hagrid</PER> entered the Great Hall.
“Aha!” he yelled, seeing <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Puffing loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed the  tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier,  until at last they heard the murmur of voices above  them and knew they had reached the classroom.
There were no doors off this landing, but  <PER>Ron</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and pointed at the ceiling, where  there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on  it.
“After you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning, so <PER>Harry</PER> climbed the  ladder first.
<PER>Ron</PER> appeared at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder as the class  assembled around them, all talking in whispers.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat themselves around the same  round table.
...”   At these words, both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> glanced,  grinning, at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked startled at the  news that books wouldn’t be much help in this  subject.
...”   When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had had their teacups filled,  they went back to their table and tried to drink the  scalding tea quickly.
“My turn ...” <PER>Ron</PER> peered into <PER>Harry</PER>’s teacup, his  forehead wrinkled with effort.
“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to  <PER>Ron</PER>, sweeping over and snatching <PER>Harry</PER>’s cup from  him.
“Everybody knows  about <PER>Harry</PER> and You-Know-Who.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her with a mixture of  amazement and admiration.
Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they  crowded around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s table, pressing close  to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s cup.
Everyone was  looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, everyone except <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had  gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor  Trelawney’s chair.
Even <PER>Ron</PER> was avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
Oh, and dear” — she  pointed at <PER>Neville</PER> — “you’ll be late next time, so mind  you work extra-hard to catch up.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> descended Professor  Trelawney’s ladder and the winding stair in silence,  then set off for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s  Transfiguration lesson.
“I see,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, fixing <PER>Harry</PER> with  her beady eyes.
<PER>Ron</PER> still looked worried, and  Lavender whispered, “But what about <PER>Neville</PER>’s cup?”   When the Transfiguration class had finished, they  joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for  lunch.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, cheer up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pushing a dish of  stew toward him.
“You heard what Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> said.”   <PER>Ron</PER> spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his  fork but didn’t start.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t  seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?”   “Yeah, I have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I saw one the night I left  the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’.”   <PER>Ron</PER> let his fork fall with a clatter.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though she had gone  mad.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, if <PER>Harry</PER>’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s  bad,” he said.
And <PER>Harry</PER>’s still  with us because he’s not stupid enough to see one  and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!”   <PER>Ron</PER> mouthed wordlessly at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who opened  her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and  propped it open against the juice jug.
“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were  telling <PER>Harry</PER> it was a sheep,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coolly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> weren’t speaking to each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked beside them in silence as they went  down the sloping lawns to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut on the edge of  the Forbidden Forest.
Right, follow me!”   For one nasty moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER>  was going to lead them into the forest; <PER>Harry</PER> had had  enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a  lifetime.
“That’s it — make sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing  yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ”   “How?” said the cold, drawling voice of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Why didn’t we guess!”   “I — I thought they were funny,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said  uncertainly to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Really witty,  giving us books that try and rip our hands off!”         “Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was  looking downcast and <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s first  lesson to be a success.
“That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a  fit when I tell him — ”   “Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated.
“Beau’iful, aren’ they?”   <PER>Harry</PER> could sort of see what <PER>Hagrid</PER> meant.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  however, approached the fence cautiously.
Don’t never insult one, ’cause it might  be the last thing yeh do.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they  were talking in an undertone and <PER>Harry</PER> had a nasty  feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the  lesson.
Even <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had misgivings.
There was an intake of breath from behind him, and  both Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no,  <PER>Harry</PER>, remember your tea leaves!”   <PER>Harry</PER> ignored them.
“Good man, <PER>Harry</PER>!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Easy, now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quietly.
“Tha’s it, <PER>Harry</PER> ... now, bow     <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his  neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told.
“Right — back  away, now, <PER>Harry</PER>, easy does it — ”   But then, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff  suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into  what was an unmistakable bow.
“Well done, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, ecstatic.
“Righ’ then, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Good work, <PER>Harry</PER>!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER> as everyone except  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> practiced  on the chestnut, while <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
“This is very easy,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> drawled, loud enough for  <PER>Harry</PER> to hear him.
“Are you, you great  ugly brute?”   It happened in a flash of steely talons; <PER>Malfoy</PER> let out a  high-pitched scream and next moment, <PER>Hagrid</PER> was  wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he  strained to get at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who lay curled in the grass,  blood blossoming over his robes.
“Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> ran to hold open the gate as <PER>Hagrid</PER> lifted  <PER>Malfoy</PER> easily.
As they passed, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that there  was a long, deep gash on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm; blood  splattered the grass and <PER>Hagrid</PER> ran with him, up the  slope toward the castle.
The  Slytherins, still muttering about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, headed away  in the direction of their dungeon common room;   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> proceeded upstairs to  Gryffindor Tower.
“That was a really bad thing to happen in <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s  first class, though, wasn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking  worried.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure they were  cooking up their own version of how <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been  injured.
“There’s a light on in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s window,” <PER>Harry</PER> said  suddenly.
...”   “I don’t know,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said slowly, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw  her glance at him.
When they reached <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, they  knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed  wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s lap.
“Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a  teacher who lasted on’y a day before.”   “You haven’t been fired, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But ’s only a matter  o’ time, i’n’t it, after <PER>Malfoy</PER> ...”   “How is he?” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they all sat down.
“It wasn’t  serious, was it?”   “Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER> dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony ... covered  in bandages ... moanin’ ...”   “He’s faking it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
Trust <PER>Malfoy</PER> to milk it for all it’s worth.”   “School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  miserably.
...”   “It’s all <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s fault, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  earnestly.
We’ll tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what really  happened.”   “Yeah, don’t worry, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, we’ll back you up,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
He grabbed both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
“I think you’ve had enough to drink, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly.
“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, letting go of  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who both staggered away, rubbing  their ribs.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> heaved himself out of his chair and  followed <PER>Hermione</PER> unsteadily outside.
“What’s he done?” said <PER>Harry</PER> nervously as <PER>Hermione</PER>  came back in with the empty tankard.
“Listen, it was good of yeh ter  come an’ see me, I really — ”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> stopped dead, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though he’d  only just realized he was there.
LETTIN’ HIM!”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> strode over to <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbed his arm, and  pulled him to the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> scowled at each other; <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t  have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d  have given them detention.
But <PER>Malfoy</PER> had always  been able to get away with anything in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s      classes; <PER>Snape</PER> was head of Slytherin House, and  generally favored his own students above all others.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> set up his cauldron right next to  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, so that they were preparing their  ingredients on the same table.
“Sir,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up  these daisy roots, because of my arm — ”   “Weasley, cut up <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s roots for him,” said <PER>Snape</PER>  without looking up.
“Weasley, you heard Professor <PER>Snape</PER>; cut up these  roots.”   <PER>Ron</PER> seized his knife, pulled <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s roots toward  him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they  were all different sizes.
“Professor,” drawled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “Weasley’s mutilating my  roots, sir.”   <PER>Snape</PER> approached their table, stared down his  hooked nose at the roots, then gave <PER>Ron</PER> an  unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black  hair.
“Change roots with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Weasley.”   “But, sir — !”       <PER>Ron</PER> had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully  shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.
<PER>Ron</PER> shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the  table at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, then took up the knife again.
“Potter, you can skin <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig,” said <PER>Snape</PER>,  giving <PER>Harry</PER> the look of loathing he always reserved  just for him.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig as <PER>Ron</PER> began trying to  repair the damage to the roots he now had to use.
<PER>Harry</PER> skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and  flung it back across the table at <PER>Malfoy</PER> without  speaking.
“Father’s not very  happy about my injury — ”   “Keep talking, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and I’ll give you a real injury,”  snarled <PER>Ron</PER>.
“To try to get <PER>Hagrid</PER>  fired.”   “Well,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, lowering his voice to a whisper,   “ partly , Potter.
<PER>Neville</PER>  regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his  worst subject, and his great fear of Professor <PER>Snape</PER>  made things ten times worse.
“Please, sir,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “please, I could help  <PER>Neville</PER> put it right — ”   “I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss  Granger,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went as  pink as <PER>Neville</PER>.
Perhaps that will encourage  you to do it properly.”   <PER>Snape</PER> moved away, leaving <PER>Neville</PER> breathless with  fear.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to  borrow <PER>Harry</PER>’s brass scales, “have you heard?
Daily  Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s  been sighted.”   “Where?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> quickly.
By the time the Ministry of Magic  got there, he was gone.”   “Not too far from here ... ,” <PER>Ron</PER> repeated, looking  significantly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Need  something else skinned?”   But <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes were shining malevolently, and they  were fixed on <PER>Harry</PER>.
I wouldn’t be staying in  school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for  him.”   “What are you talking about, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>  roughly.
I’d hunt him down myself.”   “ What are you talking about?” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, but  at that moment <PER>Snape</PER> called, “You should have  finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion  needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away  while it simmers and then we’ll test Longbottom’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of  her mouth, so that <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t see.
<PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> packed away their unused ingredients and went  to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in  the corner.
“What did <PER>Malfoy</PER> mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER> as  he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from  the gargoyle’s mouth.
...”   The end of the lesson in sight, <PER>Snape</PER> strode over to  <PER>Neville</PER>, who was cowering by his cauldron.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up Trevor the toad in  his left hand and dipped a small spoon into <PER>Neville</PER>’s  potion, which was now green.
Class dismissed.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed the steps to the  entrance hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still thinking about what  <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said, while <PER>Ron</PER> was seething about  <PER>Snape</PER>.
You should’ve  said <PER>Neville</PER> did it all by himself!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t answer.
“D’you get the feeling <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s not telling us  something?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared at <PER>Snape</PER>; it was bad  enough that he bullied <PER>Neville</PER> in his own classes, let  alone doing it in front of other teachers.
“I was hoping that <PER>Neville</PER> would assist me with the  first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure  he will perform it admirably.”         <PER>Neville</PER>’s face went, if possible, even redder.
Have you spotted it, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   Trying to answer a question with <PER>Hermione</PER> next to  him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet  with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but  <PER>Harry</PER> had a go.
And this is where you come in,  <PER>Neville</PER>.”     The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as  <PER>Neville</PER>, who walked forward as though he were  heading for the gallows.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked around rather wildly, as though  begging someone to help him, then said, in barely  more than a whisper, “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.”   Nearly everyone laughed.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> ... hmmm ... <PER>Neville</PER>, I believe you  live with your grandmother?”   “Er — yes,” said <PER>Neville</PER> nervously.
“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe,   <PER>Neville</PER>, and sees you, it will assume the form of  Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Lupin.
His first thought was Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> — a <PER>Voldemort</PER>  returned to full strength.
<PER>Ron</PER> was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.”  <PER>Harry</PER> was sure he knew what that was about.
... Everyone back, now, so  <PER>Neville</PER> can get a clear shot — ”   They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving  <PER>Neville</PER> alone beside the wardrobe.
Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>  stepped out, his eyes flashing at <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, you next!”   <PER>Ron</PER> leapt forward.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER>  thought <PER>Ron</PER> had frozen.
Then —   “RiddikulusV’ bellowed <PER>Ron</PER>, and the spider’s legs  vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown  squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt  at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
“RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split  second’s view of <PER>Snape</PER> in his lacy dress before <PER>Neville</PER>  let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart  exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke,  and was gone.
and five each to <PER>Hermione</PER>  and <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “But I didn’t do anything,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You and <PER>Hermione</PER> answered my questions correctly  at the start of the class, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin said lightly.
Only <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to  say about Professor Lupin.
The story of the boggart  assuming <PER>Snape</PER>’s shape, and the way that <PER>Neville</PER>  had dressed it in his grandmother’s clothes, had  traveled through the school like wildfire.
“What’s happened?” he asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the  fireside and completing some star charts for  Astronomy.
I’m  nearly out of Stink Pellets.”   <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself into a chair beside <PER>Ron</PER>, his high  spirits ebbing away.
“Ask <PER>McGonagall</PER> if you can go  this time, <PER>Harry</PER>.
The next one might not be for ages     “<PER>Ron</PER>\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s supposed to stay in  school — ”   “He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Ask <PER>McGonagall</PER>, go on, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “Yeah, I think I will,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making up his mind.
“You can copy mine, if you like,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, labeling  his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart  toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, don’t hurt him!” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>; the whole  common room was watching; <PER>Ron</PER> whirled the bag  around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers  came flying out of the top —   “CATCH THAT CAT!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled as Crookshanks freed  himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the  table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over; <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed  Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him  away; <PER>Ron</PER> threw himself onto his stomach and, with  great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.
“All cats chase rats,  <PER>Ron</PER>!”   “There’s something funny about that animal!” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling  Scabbers back into his pocket.
“Crookshanks could smell him, <PER>Ron</PER>, how else d’you  think — ”         “That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, ignoring  the people around him, who were starting to giggle.
<PER>Ron</PER> was still in a bad mood with <PER>Hermione</PER> next day.
He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even  though he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were working  together on the same puffapod.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had  resolved to ask Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> after the lesson  whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest,  joined the line outside the class trying to decide how  he was going to argue his case.
“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  anxiously as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went to join the  group.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  hesitated; then she said, “You — you were dreading  Binky being killed by a fox?”   “Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender,  looking up at <PER>Hermione</PER> with streaming eyes, “but I  was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?”   “Oh,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ — and she can’t have been  dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ”   “Don’t mind <PER>Hermione</PER>, Lavender,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly,  “she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very  much.”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> opened the classroom door at  that moment, which was perhaps lucky; <PER>Hermione</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> were looking daggers at each other, and  when they got into class, they seated themselves on  either side of <PER>Harry</PER> and didn’t talk to each other for  the whole class.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> when the bell rang at the end of  the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject  of Hogsmeade first.
Well, that’s all, you may  leave.”   “Ask her now,” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Go for it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for the rest of the class to disappear,  then headed nervously for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s  desk.
That’s the rule.”   “But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know,  they’re Muggles, they don’t really understand about  — about Hogwarts forms and stuff,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, while  <PER>Ron</PER> egged him on with vigorous nods.
<PER>Ron</PER> called Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> a lot of names that greatly annoyed  <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> assumed an “all-for-the-best”  expression that made <PER>Ron</PER> even angrier, and <PER>Harry</PER>  had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly  and happily about what they were going to do first,  once they got into Hogsmeade.
“There’s always the feast,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, in an effort to  cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up.
Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered  to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as  <PER>Harry</PER> had already told Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> he  hadn’t had it signed, that was no good.
<PER>Ron</PER>  halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> stamped on that one, reminding <PER>Ron</PER> what  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told them about the dementors  being able to see through them.
“All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and  Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the  Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really,  <PER>Harry</PER>, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.”   On Halloween morning, <PER>Harry</PER> awoke with the rest  and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly  depressed, though doing his best to act normally.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> had finally  forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the  face of <PER>Harry</PER>’s difficulties.
Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>!”         It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in  awe of <PER>Harry</PER> and never missed an opportunity to  speak to him.
Hey” — Colin looked eagerly around at his friends —  “you can come and sit with us, if you like, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who wasn’t in  the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the  scar on his forehead.
But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t go back to the common room; he  climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the  Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another  corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms  said, “<PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> doubled back to see who had spoken and met  Professor Lupin, looking around his office door.
“Where are <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Hogsmeade,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in a would-be casual voice.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told me,” said Lupin, passing  <PER>Harry</PER> a chipped mug of tea.
Something of <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts seemed to have shown  on his face, because Lupin said, “Anything worrying  you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied.
“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that  if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of  Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared.
The  only person <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard say the name aloud  (apart from himself) was Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I imagined  that people would panic.”   “I didn’t think of <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> honestly.
Very wise, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank  some more tea.
Could you leave it here on the desk for me?”   <PER>Snape</PER> set down the smoking goblet, his eyes  wandering between <PER>Harry</PER> and Lupin.
Thanks  very much, Severus.”   “Not at all,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, but there was a look in his  eye <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like.
I am very lucky to be  working alongside Professor <PER>Snape</PER>; there aren’t many  wizards who are up to making it.”   Professor Lupin took another sip and <PER>Harry</PER> had a  crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.
It was dusk, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had just  turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the  cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time  of their lives.
“But if he — you know” — <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped her  voice, glancing nervously around — “if he was trying  to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in  front of <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Yeah, maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as they reached the  entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall.
The food was delicious; even <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who  were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets,  managed second helpings of everything.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved his eyes along the  table, to the place where <PER>Snape</PER> sat.
It had been such a pleasant evening that <PER>Harry</PER>’s good  mood couldn’t even be spoiled by <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who  shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,  “The dementors send their love, Potter!”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed the rest of the  Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower,  but when they reached the corridor that ended with  the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed  with students.
A moment later, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was there,  sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors  squeezed together to let him through, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to see what the trouble  was.
“Oh, my — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> took one quick look at the ruined  painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see  Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Lupin, and <PER>Snape</PER> hurrying  toward him.
“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough  search of the castle,” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told them  as Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick closed all  doors into the hall.
Lights out in ten  minutes!”   “C’mon,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>; they seized  three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> obviously thinks he might be,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered  to read Hogwarts, A History?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> crossly  to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
Percy was only a short way away from <PER>Harry</PER>,      <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who quickly pretended to be  asleep as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s footsteps drew nearer.
“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the  next.”   <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to  where they stood; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s back was to him, but  he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s profile, which looked angry.
I did  express my concerns when you appointed — ”   “I do not believe a single person inside this castle  would have helped Black enter it,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  and his tone made it so clear that the subject was  closed that <PER>Snape</PER> didn’t reply.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
To cap it all, Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> summoned <PER>Harry</PER> into her office, with  such a somber expression on her face <PER>Harry</PER> thought  someone must have died.
“There’s nothing wrong with <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm!” said <PER>Harry</PER>  furiously.
The third time this happened, Wood talked  for so long that <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized he was ten  minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and  set off at a run with Wood shouting after him,  “Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, <PER>Harry</PER>, so you might  want to try looping him — ”         <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against  the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and  dashed inside.
“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor  Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have  covered so far — ”         “Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas,  and grindylows,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, “and we’re  just about to start — ”   “Be quiet,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly.
“But, sir,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, seemingly unable to  restrain herself, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves  yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ”   “Miss Granger,” said <PER>Snape</PER> in a voice of deadly calm,  “I was under the impression that I am teaching this  lesson, not you.
“Anyone?” <PER>Snape</PER> said, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It was a  mark of how much the class loathed <PER>Snape</PER> that they  were all glaring at him, because every one of them  had called <PER>Hermione</PER> a know-it-all at least once, and  <PER>Ron</PER>, who told <PER>Hermione</PER> she was a know-it-all at least  twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question  and she knows the answer!
<PER>Snape</PER>  advanced on <PER>Ron</PER> slowly, and the room held its  breath.
“Detention, Weasley,” <PER>Snape</PER> said silkily, his face very  close to <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
Weasley, stay behind, we need to  arrange your detention.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the room with the rest of the  class, who waited until they were well out of earshot,  then burst into a furious tirade about <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> ’s never been like this with any of our other  Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did  want the job,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“D’you know what that — ” (he called <PER>Snape</PER>  something that made <PER>Hermione</PER> say “<PER>Ron</PER>\”) “ — is  making me do?
“You know, I reckon <PER>Ron</PER> was right about you,” <PER>Harry</PER>  told Crookshanks suspiciously.
Just before  he entered the locker room, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>,   Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from  under an enormous umbrella on their way to the  stadium.
Give me your glasses, quick!”   He handed them to her, and as the team watched in  amazement, <PER>Hermione</PER> tapped them with her wand  and said, “Imperviusl”   “There!” she said, handing them back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> needed to get the  Snitch quickly —   He turned, intending to head back toward the middle  of the field, but at that moment, another flash of  lightning illuminated the stands, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw  something that distracted him completely — the  silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly  imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost,  empty row of seats.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, behind you!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked wildly around.
“Not <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Harry</PER>, please not <PER>Harry</PER>\”       “ Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now.
...”     “ Not <PER>Harry</PER>, please no, take me, kill me instead — ”   Numbing, swirling white mist was filling <PER>Harry</PER>’s  brain.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were also there,       looking as though they’d just climbed out of a  swimming pool.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved nearer to  <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was really angry,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a  quaking voice.
He looked up and saw  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looking at him so anxiously that  he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to  say.
“Did someone get my Nimbus?”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked quickly at each other.
“And?”         “And it hit — it hit — oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — it hit the  Whomping Willow.”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides lurched.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that  looked like yellow cabbages, and <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley,  blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she  had made herself, which sang shrilly unless <PER>Harry</PER>  kept it shut under his bowl of fruit.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside only  at night.
He hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, because he knew <PER>Ron</PER> would panic  and <PER>Hermione</PER> would scoff.
When the  dementors approached him, he heard the last  moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect  him, <PER>Harry</PER>, from Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  laughter before he murdered her.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the  main school on Monday, where he was forced to think  about other things, even if he had to endure <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s taunting.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> spent much of their next      Potions class doing dementor imitations across the  dungeon; <PER>Ron</PER> finally cracked and flung a large,  slippery crocodile heart at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, which hit him in  the face and caused <PER>Snape</PER> to take fifty points from  Gryffindor.
“If <PER>Snape</PER>’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts  again, I’m skiving off,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they headed  toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch.
“Check who’s  in there, <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> peered around the classroom door.
It certainly looked  as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging  more loosely on him and there were dark shadows  beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class  as they took their seats, and they burst at once into  an explosion of complaints about <PER>Snape</PER>’s behavior  while Lupin had been ill.   “It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give  us homework?”   “We don’t know anything about werewolves — ”   “ — two rolls of parchment!”   “Did you tell Professor <PER>Snape</PER> we haven’t covered them  yet?” Lupin asked, frowning slightly.
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things  and headed for the door, <PER>Harry</PER> among them, but —   “Wait a moment, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin called.
“I can hear <PER>Voldemort</PER>  murdering my mum.”   Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though  to grip <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, but thought better of it.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and  though <PER>Ron</PER> said it was because he couldn’t stand two  weeks with Percy, and <PER>Hermione</PER> insisted she needed  to use the library, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t fooled; they were  doing it to keep him company, and he was very  grateful.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip,  <PER>Harry</PER> bid good-bye to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were  wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the  marble staircase alone, and headed back toward  Gryffindor Tower.
“Explain, George.”   “Well ... when we were in our first year, <PER>Harry</PER> —  young, carefree, and innocent — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> snorted.
He edged among  them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he  imagined the look that would spread over <PER>Dudley</PER>’s  piggy face if he could see where <PER>Harry</PER> was now.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  were standing underneath it, examining a tray of  blood-flavored lollipops.
“Ugh, no, <PER>Harry</PER> won’t want one of those, they’re for  vampires, I expect,” <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
“How about these?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shoving ajar of  Cockroach Clusters under <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s nose.
“<PER>Harry</PER>\” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
How — how did you — ?”   “Wow!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking very impressed, “you’ve  learned to Apparate!”   “ ’Course I haven’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m their brother!”   “But <PER>Harry</PER> isn’t going to keep it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as  though the idea were ludicrous.
“He’s going to hand it  in to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, aren’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “No, I’m not!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you mad?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, goggling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Now?”   “He’d have a job spotting <PER>Harry</PER> in this,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick,  swirling snow.
<PER>Harry</PER> deserves a break.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> bit her lip, looking extremely worried.
“Oh — of course not — but honestly, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.
“Reckon Fred’d take a bit of  Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?”   When <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had paid for all their sweets,  the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard  outside.
They headed up the street, heads bowed  against the wind, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouting  through their scarves.
“That’s the post office — ”   “Zonko’s is up there — ”   “We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ”   “Tell you what,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his teeth chattering, “shall  we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?”   <PER>Harry</PER> was more than willing; the wind was fierce and  his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road,  and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> made their way to the back of  the room, where there was a small, vacant table  between the window and a handsome Christmas tree,  which stood next to the fireplace.
Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick had just entered  the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed  by <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was deep in conversation with a portly  man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped  cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had both placed  hands on the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and forced him off  his stool and under the table.
“Did you tell the whole pub, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> exasperatedly.
They’re in a fury against  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — he won’t let them inside the castle  grounds.”   “I should think not,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  sharply.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, please!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
An’  then he says, ‘Give <PER>Harry</PER> ter me, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, I’m his  godfather, I’ll look after him — ’ Ha!
But I’d had me  orders from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, an’ I told Black no,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said <PER>Harry</PER> was ter go ter his aunt an’  uncle’s.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces appeared under the table.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge ... why hadn’t anyone  ever mentioned the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died  because their best friend had betrayed them?
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> nervously all  through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d  overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice uncertainly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you — you look terrible.”   <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak.
He had  awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and  gone down the spiral staircase to a common room  that was completely empty except for <PER>Ron</PER>, who was  eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his  stomach, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had spread her  homework over three tables.
It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, listen,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, exchanging a look with  <PER>Ron</PER>, “you must be really upset about what we heard  yesterday.
“You won’t, will you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“D’you know what I see and hear every time a  dementor gets too near me?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  shook their heads, looking apprehensive.
And if you found out someone who was  supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent  <PER>Voldemort</PER> after her — ”   “There’s nothing you can do!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking  stricken.
“<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   Again, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t answer.
... I’d want revenge.’ ”   “You’re going to take <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s advice instead of ours?”  said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously.
Black’s a madman,  <PER>Harry</PER>, and he’s dangerous — ”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s dad must have told him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He was right in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s inner  circle — ”   “ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected <PER>Ron</PER>  angrily.
“ — so obviously, the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s knew Black was working  for <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ”   “ — and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’d love to see you blown into about a  million pieces, like Pettigrew!
<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s just       hoping you 11 get yourself killed before he has to play  you at Quidditch.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, please,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her eyes now shining  with tears, “please be sensible.
“<PER>Harry</PER> isn’t supposed to  leave the castle, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “Yeah, let’s go,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting up, “and I can ask  him how come he never mentioned Black when he  told me all about my parents!”   Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t  what <PER>Ron</PER> had had in mind.
Percy left a set — ”   “No, let’s visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly.
“Listen — is that  Fang?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> put their ears to the door too.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” called <PER>Harry</PER>, thumping the door.
<PER>Harry</PER>, about to collapse  under <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s weight, was rescued by <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who each seized <PER>Hagrid</PER> under an arm and  heaved him back into the cabin.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what is it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, aghast.
“What’s this, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter  toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who picked it up and read aloud:   Dear Mr. <PER>Hagrid</PER>,   Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on  a student in your class, we have accepted the  assurances of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that you bear no  responsibility for the regrettable incident.
“Well, that’s okay then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping  <PER>Hagrid</PER> on the shoulder.
But <PER>Hagrid</PER> continued to sob,  and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting <PER>Harry</PER> to  read on.
“They’ve got it in fer  interestin’ creatures!”   A sudden sound from the corner of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin  made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whip around.
At Christmas.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sitting down and laying a hand on  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s massive forearm.
“What about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Got enough on his plate what with keepin’  them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black  lurkin’ around — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked quickly at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though  expecting him to start berating <PER>Hagrid</PER> for not telling  him the truth about Black.
But <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t bring  himself to do it, not now that he saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> so  miserable and scared.
I’ll look it up for you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and see exactly what  happened.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> howled still more loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  looked at <PER>Ron</PER> to help them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> watched him breathlessly.
After a pause, <PER>Hermione</PER> said timidly, “Is it  awful in there, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   “Yeh’ve no idea,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quietly.
“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.”   The trip to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, though far from fun, had  nevertheless had the effect <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had  hoped.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> had by no means forgotten  about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on revenge  if he wanted to help <PER>Hagrid</PER> win his case against the  Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went to the library the next  day and returned to the empty common room laden  with books that might help prepare a defense for  Buckbeak.
On Christmas morning, <PER>Harry</PER> was woken by <PER>Ron</PER>  throwing his pillow at him.
Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?”   “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it  wasn’t the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.”         “I bet it was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now walking  around and around the Firebolt, taking in every  glorious inch.
Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>” — <PER>Ron</PER> gave a great whoop of  laughter — “<PER>Malfoy</PER>l Wait till he sees you on this!
This is an international standard  broom, this is!”   “I can’t believe this,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, running a hand  along the Firebolt, while <PER>Ron</PER> sank onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed,  laughing his head off at the thought of <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“ Who  — ?”   “I know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, controlling himself, “I know who it  could’ve been — Lupin!”   “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, now starting to laugh himself.
“I  was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention  from <PER>Snape</PER>, remember?”   <PER>Harry</PER> frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>\ Who sent you that?”   “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well ... who’d send <PER>Harry</PER> something as expensive as  that, and not even tell him they’d sent it?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“What d’you think <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to do with it — sweep  the floor?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, Crookshanks  sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at <PER>Ron</PER>’s chest.
<PER>Ron</PER> seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a  misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at  the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, knocking it over and causing  <PER>Ron</PER> to hop up and down, howling with pain.
“You’d better take that cat out of here, <PER>Hermione</PER>,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously, sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed nursing his  toe.
“Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to  <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> strode out of the room,  Crookshanks ’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on  <PER>Ron</PER>.
It had been a  while since <PER>Harry</PER> had seen him out of <PER>Ron</PER>’s pocket,  and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that  Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches  of fur seemed to have fallen out too.
And despite <PER>Ron</PER>’s frequent  complaints that Scabbers was both boring and  useless, he was sure <PER>Ron</PER> would be very miserable if  Scabbers died.
<PER>Hermione</PER>       had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was  furious with <PER>Ron</PER> for trying to kick him; <PER>Ron</PER> was still  fuming about Crookshanks ’s fresh attempt to eat  Scabbers.
Professors  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, Sprout, and  Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker,  who had taken off his usual brown coat and was  wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.
“Merry Christmas!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> approached the table.
Sit down, sit down!”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down side by side at  the end of the table.
“Crackers!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> enthusiastically, offering  the end of a large silver noisemaker to <PER>Snape</PER>, who  took it reluctantly and tugged.
<PER>Harry</PER>, remembering the boggart, caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye  and they both grinned; <PER>Snape</PER> ’s mouth thinned and       he pushed the hat toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who swapped  it for his wizard’s hat at once.
“Let me draw you up a chair — ”   And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his  wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling  with a thud between Professors <PER>Snape</PER> and  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“I doubt,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a cheerful but slightly  raised voice, which put an end to Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Professor Trelawney’s conversation,  “that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger.
Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still  wearing their party hats, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got up first  from the table and she shrieked loudly.
Which?”   “Dunno,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking uneasily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I doubt it will make much difference,” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waiting  outside the doors to slaughter the first into the  entrance hall.”         Even <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“Coming?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“No,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered, “I want a quick word with  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.”   “Probably trying to see if she can take any more  classes,” yawned <PER>Ron</PER> as they made their way into the  entrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad  axe-men.
<PER>Harry</PER> went straight up to the dormitory, collected the  Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit <PER>Hermione</PER>  had given him for his birthday, brought them  downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the  Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip,  and the handle was so shiny already it seemed  pointless to polish it.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> simply sat admiring  it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> came in, accompanied by Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Though Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was head of Gryffindor  House, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen her in the common room only       once before, and that had been to make a very grave  announcement.
“Miss Granger has just informed me that you  have been sent a broomstick, Potter.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay  Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it  down — ”   “Strip it down?” repeated <PER>Ron</PER>, as though Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> was mad.
<PER>Ron</PER>,  however, rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What did you go running to <PER>McGonagall</PER> for?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> threw her book aside.
“Because I thought — and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent  to <PER>Harry</PER> by Sirius Black!”          THE PATRONUS   <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> had meant well, but that  didn’t stop him from being angry with her.
<PER>Ron</PER> was furious with <PER>Hermione</PER> too.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> supposed she had taken refuge in the  library and didn’t try to persuade her to come back.
How could he just  walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a  broomstick?”   “I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but <PER>McGonagall</PER> still wants to  strip it down — ”   Wood went pale.
“She doesn’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, staring resentfully after  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a  Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-  dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between  you and the dementor.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had a sudden vision of himself crouching  behind a <PER>Hagrid</PER>-sized figure holding a large club.
“Expecto patronum).”   “Expecto patronum,” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated under his breath,  “expecto patronum.”   “Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”   “Oh — yeah — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, quickly forcing his  thoughts back to that first broom ride.
<PER>Harry</PER> was falling again through thick white fog,  and his mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing  inside his head — “ Not <PER>Harry</PER>\ Not <PER>Harry</PER>\ Please — I’ll  do anything — ”   “Stand aside.
Stand aside, girl\”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!”       <PER>Harry</PER> jerked back to life.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than  understand — ”   “I do!” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely, stuffing the rest of the  Chocolate Frog into his mouth.
The dementor glided  forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was  extending toward <PER>Harry</PER> —   “Expecto patronum).” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“ EXPECTO  PATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ”   The screaming inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head had started again  — except this time, it sounded as though it were  coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder  and softer again — and he could still see the  dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver  shadow came bursting out of the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand,  to hover between him and the dementor, and though  <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet —  though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure —   “ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.
You’d better be off, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s getting late.”   <PER>Harry</PER> left the classroom, walking along the corridor  and around a corner, then took a detour behind a  suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish  his chocolate, wishing he hadn’t mentioned Black, as  Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject.
“How’s she doing it?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> one  evening as <PER>Harry</PER> sat finishing a nasty essay on  Undetectable Poisons for <PER>Snape</PER>.
And Ernie  McMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle  Studies class, but half of them are at the same time  as Divination, and she’s never missed one of them  either!”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s impossible schedule at the moment; he  really needed to get on with <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay.
There’s an order form at the back of Which  Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand  and One, like <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s got.”   “I’m not buying anything <PER>Malfoy</PER> thinks is good,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
He was  now asking Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> for news of the  Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, <PER>Ron</PER>         standing hopefully at his shoulder, <PER>Hermione</PER> rushing  past with her face averted.
“Oh — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> brought me some back  from Hogsmeade,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> half wished that he hadn’t asked what was  under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so  horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of  what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of  you that he walked headlong into Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> halfway up the stairs.
Then, spotting  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!
He is trying to force  entry to the chambers within!”   “Oh, shut up,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as he and <PER>Harry</PER> drew level  with <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Where ’d you get it, <PER>Harry</PER>?”       “Will you let me have a go?”   “Have you ridden it yet, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on  Cleansweep Sevens!”   “Can I just hold it, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was  passed around and admired from every angle, the  crowd dispersed and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had a clear view  of <PER>Hermione</PER>, the only person who hadn’t rushed over  to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding  their eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> approached her table and  at last, she looked up.
“Can I sit down, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at the cluttered table, at the  long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still  glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay  (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the  rune translation <PER>Hermione</PER> was now poring over.
SCABBERS!”     <PER>Hermione</PER> was leaning away from <PER>Ron</PER>, looking utterly  bewildered.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the sheet <PER>Ron</PER> was  holding.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw something down onto <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s rune  translation.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward.
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW   It looked like the end of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  friendship.
<PER>Ron</PER> was enraged that <PER>Hermione</PER> had never taken  Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously,  hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him,  and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was  innocent by suggesting that <PER>Ron</PER> look for Scabbers  under all the boys’ beds.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile,  maintained fiercely that <PER>Ron</PER> had no proof that  Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger  hairs might have been there since Christmas, and  that <PER>Ron</PER> had been prejudiced against her cat ever  since Crookshanks had landed on <PER>Ron</PER>’s head in the  Magical Menagerie.
Personally, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Crookshanks had  eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to  <PER>Hermione</PER> that the evidence all pointed that way, she  lost her temper with <PER>Harry</PER> too.
Just leave me alone, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’ve got a  lot of work to do!”   <PER>Ron</PER> had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.
“Remember, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yeah, that’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Oh, come on, <PER>Ron</PER>, get yourself  down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what’s the  point of moaning?”   In a last-ditch attempt to cheer <PER>Ron</PER> up, <PER>Harry</PER>  persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team’s  final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he  could have a ride on the Firebolt after they’d finished.
...” Wood  scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a  full recovery, then said, “On the other hand, she rides  a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke  next to the Firebolt.” He gave <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom a look of  fervent admiration, then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s  go     And at long last, <PER>Harry</PER> mounted his Firebolt, and  kicked off from the ground.
The Firebolt  turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his       thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field  at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-  and-gray blur; <PER>Harry</PER> turned it so sharply that Alicia  Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly  controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes  before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again —   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.
“Not unless — <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve sorted out your  dementor problem, haven’t you?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking of his feeble Patronus  and wishing it were stronger.
Let’s get back to the tower ... turn in  early — ”   “I’m staying out for a bit; <PER>Ron</PER> wants a go on the  Firebolt,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Wood, and while the rest of the  team headed off to the locker rooms, <PER>Harry</PER> strode  over to <PER>Ron</PER>, who vaulted the barrier to the stands  and came to meet him.
“Here you go,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing <PER>Ron</PER> the Firebolt.
<PER>Ron</PER>, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted  the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness  while <PER>Harry</PER> walked around the edge of the field,  watching him.
Night had fallen before Madam Hooch  awoke with a start, told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> off for not  waking her, and insisted that they go back to the  castle.
<PER>Harry</PER> shouldered the Firebolt and he and <PER>Ron</PER> walked  out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s  superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration,  and its pinpoint turning.
Slightly  ashamed of his moment of panic, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t say  anything to <PER>Ron</PER> — nor did he look left or right until  they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
“Did you see his face?” said <PER>Ron</PER> gleefully, looking  back at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe  and Goyle right behind him.
“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,”  said <PER>Harry</PER>.
They watched  him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put  their heads together, no doubt asking <PER>Malfoy</PER> whether  <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom really was a Firebolt.
She was shorter than <PER>Harry</PER> by about a head, and  <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that  she was extremely pretty.
<PER>Harry</PER> dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore  after him — <PER>Harry</PER> was speeding up, excitement  flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet  away —   Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters,  came pelting out of nowhere; <PER>Harry</PER> veered off course,  avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial  seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a  Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a  glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was  circling the Gryffindor goal post —   <PER>Harry</PER> accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold  ahead — but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air,  blocking him —   “HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!”  Wood roared as <PER>Harry</PER> swerved to avoid a collision.
Alicia, Angelina,  and Katie had all kissed <PER>Harry</PER>; Fred had him in a grip  so tight <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though his head would come off.
<PER>Harry</PER> got off his broom and  looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters  sprinting onto the field, <PER>Ron</PER> in the lead.
“Yes!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, yanking <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm into the air.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who had fought his way  through to <PER>Harry</PER>’s side, doubled up with laughter as       they watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> fighting to extricate himself from  the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.
“And I’m very glad we       won, and I think you did really well, but I need to  read this by Monday.”   “Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, come and have some food,”  <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking over at <PER>Ron</PER> and wondering  whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the  hatchet.
“Can’t you give her a break?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>  quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed the stairs to  their dormitory, still discussing the match.
“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “I’m telling you, I saw him!”   “What’s all the noise?”   “Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told us to go to bed!”   A few of the girls had come down their staircase,  pulling on dressing gowns and yawning.
“You had too  much to eat, <PER>Ron</PER> — had a nightmare — ”     “I’m telling you — ”   “Now, really, enough’s enough!”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was back.
My brother <PER>Ron</PER>  here had a nightmare — ”   “IT WASNT A NIGHTMARE!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled.
“Ask him if he saw — ”   Glaring suspiciously at <PER>Ron</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  pushed the portrait back open and went outside.
It seemed that Fred and George had  been right in thinking that they — and now <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> — were the only ones who knew  about the hidden passageway within it.
“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had  been broken into.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Ron</PER> took this view.
For the first  time in his life, people were paying more attention to  him than to <PER>Harry</PER>, and it was clear that <PER>Ron</PER> was  rather enjoying the experience.
“Why, though?” <PER>Ron</PER> added to <PER>Harry</PER> as the group of  second-year girls who had been listening to his  chilling tale departed.
Why had  Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced <PER>Ron</PER>  and proceeded to <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who were sitting opposite  him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — <PER>Ron</PER>  had got one from his mother the year before.
“Run for it, <PER>Neville</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> advised.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too busy feeling sorry for <PER>Neville</PER> to notice  immediately that he had a letter too.
Oh — thanks, Hedwig.”   <PER>Harry</PER> tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped  herself to some of <PER>Neville</PER>’s cornflakes.
The note inside  said:   Dear <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>,   How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round  six?
WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL;   YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN  Cheers,   <PER>Hagrid</PER>   “He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
So at six o’clock that afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> left  Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run,  and headed down to the entrance hall.
“All right, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
The first thing they saw on entering <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin  was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded  tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead  ferrets.
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight,  <PER>Harry</PER> saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very  horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s wardrobe door.
“What are they for, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> poured them tea and offered them a plate of  Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they  had had too much experience with <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cooking.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
...”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, we should’ve helped as well — sorry — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> began awkwardly.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, waving <PER>Harry</PER>’s  apology aside.
Tha’s all.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged uncomfortable looks.
She’s got her heart in the right place,  <PER>Hermione</PER> has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her — ”         “If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her  again!” <PER>Ron</PER> said angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> started  and looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was sitting at  the table right behind them and clearing a space in  the wall of books that had been hiding her.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I’ll tell  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> about that map!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Can you hear someone talking, <PER>Harry</PER>?” growled <PER>Ron</PER>,  not looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
After what  Sirius Black nearly did to youl I mean it, I’ll tell — ”   “So now you’re trying to get <PER>Harry</PER> expelled!” said <PER>Ron</PER>  furiously.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  took one frightened look at the expression on <PER>Ron</PER>’s  face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away  toward the girls’ dormitories.
“So how about it?” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> as though there  had been no interruption.
You haven’t even been  inside Zonko’s yet!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around to check that <PER>Hermione</PER> was well  out of earshot.
“ ’Bye!” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly pulled out his wand, muttered,   “ Dissendium).” and shoved his bag into the statue, but  before he could climb in himself, <PER>Neville</PER> came around  the corner.
I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade  either!”   “Hi, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving swiftly away from the  statue and pushing the map back into his pocket.
<PER>Neville</PER> took a quick step behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“An odd place to meet — ”   To <PER>Harry</PER>’s immense disquiet, <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes  flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and  then to the one-eyed witch.
I suggest the pair of you  return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> set off without another word.
<PER>Harry</PER> managed to shake <PER>Neville</PER> off at the Fat Lady by  telling him the password, then pretending he’d left his  vampire essay in the library and doubling back.
<PER>Harry</PER>  scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of  relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was  now back in its office.
<PER>Harry</PER>, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility  Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes  and prodded <PER>Ron</PER> in the back.
...”   They went to the post office; <PER>Ron</PER> pretended to be  checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that  <PER>Harry</PER> could have a good look around.
There were jokes and  tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest  dreams; <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> whispered orders and passed  him some gold from under the cloak.
that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> suddenly caught sight of <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What are you doing, Weasley?”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked up at the crumbling house behind <PER>Ron</PER>.
I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that  true?”       <PER>Harry</PER> seized the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes to stop him from  leaping on <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept  silently around behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle,  bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of  the path.
“We were just discussing your friend <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Malfoy</PER>  said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe,  and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly  around, <PER>Malfoy</PER> trying to wipe his hair clean.
“It came from over there!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, wiping his  face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of  <PER>Harry</PER>.
As <PER>Ron</PER> was the only person Crabbe could  see, it was <PER>Ron</PER> he started toward, but <PER>Harry</PER> stuck  out his leg.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, stumbling forward and staring  hopelessly at the point where <PER>Harry</PER> had disappeared,  “you’d better run for it!
If <PER>Malfoy</PER> tells anyone — you’d  better get back to the castle, quick — ”         “See you later,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and without another  word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach turned over — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would  know exactly what had happened, if <PER>Malfoy</PER> said  anything —   Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps,  across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — <PER>Harry</PER>  pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran,  flat out, along the passage.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his  hands clean on the inside of his robes without <PER>Snape</PER>  noticing.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> has just been to see me with a strange  story, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“I don’t know, Professor.”   <PER>Snape</PER>’s eyes were boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
“It sounds like <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s having  hallucin — ”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> is not having hallucinations,” snarled <PER>Snape</PER>,  and he bent down, a hand on each arm of <PER>Harry</PER>’s  chair, so that their faces were a foot apart.
Famous <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for  the consequences.”   <PER>Harry</PER> stayed silent.
“<PER>Ron</PER> gave them to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, praying he’d get a  chance to tip <PER>Ron</PER> off before <PER>Snape</PER> saw him.
<PER>Snape</PER> turned it over, his eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor Severus <PER>Snape</PER>, master of this school,  commands you to yield the information you conceal!”  <PER>Snape</PER> said, hitting the map with his wand.
Moony presents his compliments to Professor  <PER>Snape</PER>, and begs him to keep his abnormally large  nose out of other people’s business.”   <PER>Snape</PER> froze.
Wormtail bids Professor <PER>Snape</PER> good day, and  advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”   <PER>Harry</PER> waited for the blow to fall.
I  imagine <PER>Harry</PER> got it from a joke shop — ”   “Indeed?” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
You don’t think it more likely that he  got it directly from the manufacturers?”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t understand what <PER>Snape</PER> was talking  about.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, do you know any of these men?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay  — excuse us, Severus — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare look at <PER>Snape</PER> as they left his office.
Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  looked amazed.
And I can’t let you have it back, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had expected that, and was too keen for  explanations to protest.
A poor way to repay them —  gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”   He walked away, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> feeling worse by far  than he had at any point in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>   “They can’t do this,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Buckbeak isn’t dangerous.”        “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, wiping her eyes.
I’ll help.”   “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> flung her arms around <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck and  broke down completely.
You never know, Mum and Dad  might get me an owl now.”   The safety measures imposed on the students since  Black’s second break-in made it impossible for <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the  evenings.
“S’no good, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> sadly as they reached  the castle steps.
“And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both made furious moves toward  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> got there first — SMACK!
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as  <PER>Hermione</PER> raised her hand again.
“Don’t you dare call <PER>Hagrid</PER> pathetic, you foul — you  evil — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly, and he tried to grab her  hand as she swung it back.
“Get off, <PER>Ron</PER>!”       <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled out her wand.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> said again, sounding both stunned  and impressed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!”  <PER>Hermione</PER> said shrilly.
“You just better had, because I  can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!”   “We’re due in Charms,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still goggling at  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Come along,  quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with  Cheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into  pairs — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried to a desk at the back and  opened their bags.
“Where’s <PER>Hermione</PER> gone?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around too.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t entered  the classroom, yet <PER>Harry</PER> knew she had been right  next to him when he had opened the door.
“That’s weird,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Ron</PER>.
By the time they  had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the  Cheering Charms were wearing off, and <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> had started to get slightly worried.
“You don’t think <PER>Malfoy</PER> did something to her?” <PER>Ron</PER>  said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward  Gryffindor Tower.
Oh, it was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I was thinking  about him and I lost track of things!”   “You know what, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking down  at the enormous Arithmancy book <PER>Hermione</PER> had  been using as a pillow.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down together at the same rickety table.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> choked back laughs.
It didn’t help that <PER>Ron</PER>  kept breaking into silent giggles and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept  tutting.
There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.”   Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> burst out laughing.
She turned abruptly from <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER>’s table, breathing rather heavily as she  tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.
“Some day <PER>Hermione</PER>’s having, eh?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to  <PER>Harry</PER>, looking awed.
The enmity between <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Malfoy</PER> was at its highest point ever.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was      still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in  Hogsmeade and was even more furious that <PER>Harry</PER>  had somehow wormed his way out of punishment.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t forgotten <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s attempt to sabotage  him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the  matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined  to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> in front of the entire school.
<PER>Harry</PER> was  sitting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, removed from the  center of things, trying not to think about the next  day, because every time he did, he had the horrible  sensation that something very large was fighting to  get out of his stomach.
We had to use <PER>Neville</PER> instead!” Then he dreamed  that <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived  for the match riding dragons.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed.
Wake up!”       “Huh?”     “I need you to tell me if you can see something!”   “S’all dark, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered thickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked even paler  than usual.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt  his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him  in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw  <PER>Malfoy</PER> on his tail, and sped off in search of the  Snitch.
He had seen the  Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the  Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t catch it yet —  and if <PER>Malfoy</PER> saw it —   Faking a look of sudden concentration, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled  his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin  end — it worked.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> went haring after him,  clearly thinking <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the Snitch there.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was still  keeping close to <PER>Harry</PER> as he soared over the match,  looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty  points ahead —   Katie scored.
<PER>Harry</PER> could almost feel hundreds of eyes following  him as he soared around the field, high above the rest  of the game, with <PER>Malfoy</PER> speeding along behind him.
“You — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> was angry enough to hit <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but couldn’t  reach — <PER>Malfoy</PER> was panting with the effort of holding  onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling  maliciously.
The Gryffindor team was  losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s foul on <PER>Harry</PER>, were being spurred on to  greater heights.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> was now marking <PER>Malfoy</PER> so closely their knees  kept hitting each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t going to let  <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere near the Snitch.
...       “Get out of it, Potter!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> yelled in frustration as  he tried to turn and found <PER>Harry</PER> blocking him.
Every single Slytherin player  apart from <PER>Malfoy</PER> was streaking up the pitch toward  Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were  all going to block her —   <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he  was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was diving, a look of triumph on his face  — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny,  golden glimmer —   <PER>Harry</PER> urged the Firebolt downward, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> was  miles ahead —   “Go!
He was gaining  on <PER>Malfoy</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> flattened himself to the broom  handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s ankles — he was level —       <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself forward, took both hands off his  broom.
Thrust into the light, he  saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh  beat ’em, <PER>Harry</PER>, yeh beat ’em!
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> was sobbing harder even than Wood,  wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag;  and there, fighting their way toward <PER>Harry</PER>, were <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
They simply  beamed as <PER>Harry</PER> was borne toward the stands, where  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood waiting with the enormous  Quidditch Cup.
... As a  sobbing Wood passed <PER>Harry</PER> the Cup, as he lifted it  into the air, <PER>Harry</PER> felt he could have produced the  world’s best Patronus.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had given up asking her how she was  managing to attend several classes at once, but they  couldn’t restrain themselves when they saw the exam  schedule she had drawn up for herself.
The first  column read:   Monday   9 o’clock, Arithmancy  9 o’clock, Transfiguration  Lunch   1 o’clock, Charms  1 o’clock, Ancient Runes   “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said cautiously, because she was  liable to explode when interrupted these days.
“It’s from <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ripping the note open.
“I’ve spent ages reading up  on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!”   But <PER>Harry</PER> had a horrible feeling that the Committee  for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its  mind made up for it by Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
From sneering  comments <PER>Harry</PER> overheard, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was certain  Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed  thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about.
It was all <PER>Harry</PER> could do to stop himself imitating  <PER>Hermione</PER> and hitting <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face on these  occasions.
And the worst thing of all was that they      had no time or opportunity to go and see <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  because the strict new security measures had not  been lifted, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare retrieve his  Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.
<PER>Harry</PER> slightly overdid his out of  nerves and <PER>Ron</PER>, who was partnering him, ended up  in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to  a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to  perform the charm himself.
As flobberworms flourished best if left to their  own devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had  ever taken, and also gave <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  plenty of opportunity to speak to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> told them,  bending low on the pretense of checking that <PER>Harry</PER>’s  flobberworm was still alive.
Try as <PER>Harry</PER> might, he couldn’t  get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and <PER>Snape</PER>,  standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure,  scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a  zero onto his notes before moving away.
“Excellent, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin muttered as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed  out of the trunk, grinning.
“Full marks.”   Flushed with his success, <PER>Harry</PER> hung around to  watch <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What’s the matter?”   “P — P — Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped,  pointing into the trunk.
When at  last she had regained a grip on herself, she, <PER>Harry</PER>,  and <PER>Ron</PER> went back to the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER> was still slightly  inclined to laugh at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s boggart, but an  argument was averted by the sight that met them on  the top of the steps.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, not being on  speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered  awkwardly in the background.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered that they were  representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of  Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard  squinted toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin and said in a feeble  voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this.
<PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to say something, but       <PER>Hermione</PER> nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her  head toward the entrance hall.
This isn’t justice!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go  saying things like that to his boss!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  but she too looked very upset.
...”   But <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t really believe  what she was saying.
All around them, people were  talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily  anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, lost in worry about <PER>Hagrid</PER>  and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s last exam was Divination;  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the  marble staircase together; <PER>Hermione</PER> left them on the  first floor and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> proceeded all the way  up to the seventh, where many of their class were  sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s  classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute  studying.
“She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you,   I’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked <PER>Neville</PER> as he  clambered back down the ladder toward <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER>, who had now reached the landing.
“You know, I’m  starting to think <PER>Hermione</PER> was right about her” — he  jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead —  “she’s a right old fraud.”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at his own watch.
“She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” she  informed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> grimaced at <PER>Harry</PER> and climbed  the silver ladder out of sight.
...”   “Meet you in the common room,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered as  Professor Trelawney’s voice called, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”   The tower room was hotter than ever before; the  curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the  usual sickly scent made <PER>Harry</PER> cough as he stumbled  through the clutter of chairs and tables to where  Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large  crystal ball.
No weeping <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, wanting more than ever to  leave the room and the heat.
<PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>?
Over in the  corner, however, sat <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just sent  this.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s note was dry this time, no tears had  splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so  much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.
I don’t want you to see it  <PER>Hagrid</PER>   “We’ve got to go,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I don’t know what’s gotten into you  lately!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, astounded.
“First you hit <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather flattered.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> shut the  door quickly and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak.
“Where’s Buckbeak, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  hesitantly.
“I’ll do it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, hurrying  over and starting to clean up the mess.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked back hopelessly.
“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked fiercely, sitting down next to him.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>     “He’s tried,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
... Yeh know what Lucius  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s like ... threatened ’em, I expect ... an’ the  executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s ...  but it’ll be quick an’ clean ... an’ I’ll be beside him.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had been rummaging in <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s  cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly  stifled sob.
“Well stay with you too, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she began, but  <PER>Hagrid</PER> shook his shaggy head.
If Fudge an’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> catch yeh out  without permission, <PER>Harry</PER>, yehll be in big trouble.”   Silent tears were now streaming down <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  face, but she hid them from <PER>Hagrid</PER>, bustling around  making tea.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and <PER>Hermione</PER>  picked up the cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely unreal, and even more so when  he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree  behind <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s pumpkin patch.
“It’s okay ...” He  turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, we can’t — ”   “Well tell them what really happened — ”   “They can’t kill him — ”   “Go!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> fiercely.
As <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the cloak  over <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, they heard voices at the front of  the cabin.
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> set off silently around <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house.
“Oh, please, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his  pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking  madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth  into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it’s <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed.
“Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!”  <PER>Hermione</PER> breathed.
“Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ”   They walked forward; <PER>Harry</PER>, like <PER>Hermione</PER>, was  trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind  them.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
Without thinking about  what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his arms.
He bit me!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, be quiet!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered urgently.
In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,  and before <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could stop him, <PER>Ron</PER>       had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and  pelted away into the darkness.
“<PER>Ron</PER>\” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned.
She and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, then followed at  a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the  cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them  like a banner as they hurtled after <PER>Ron</PER>; they could  hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts  at Crookshanks.
“Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> almost fell over <PER>Ron</PER>; they  skidded to a stop right in front of him.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — come on — back under the cloak — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> panted.
As the dog sprang back toward  them he pushed <PER>Harry</PER> aside; the dog’s jaws fastened  instead around <PER>Ron</PER>’s outstretched arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> lunged  forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it  was dragging <PER>Ron</PER> away as easily as though he were a  rag doll —   Then, out of nowhere, something hit <PER>Harry</PER> so hard  across the face he was knocked off his feet again.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog,  dragging <PER>Ron</PER> backward into a large gap in the roots  — <PER>Ron</PER> was fighting furiously, but his head and torso  were slipping out of sight —   “<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy  branch whipped lethally through the air and he was  forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of <PER>Ron</PER>’s legs, which  he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the  dog from pulling him farther underground — but a       horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg  had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished  from sight.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — we’ve got to go for help — ” <PER>Hermione</PER>  gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her  across the shoulder.
... All <PER>Harry</PER> could  think of was <PER>Ron</PER> and what the enormous dog might  be doing to him.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked very  frightened but nodded.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  suddenly grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking  Shack.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm was  so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> dashed across to him.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — are you okay?”   “Where’s the dog?”   “Not a dog,” <PER>Ron</PER> moaned.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> was staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wands shot out of their  hands, high in the air, and Black caught them.
... “No, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped in a petrified  whisper; <PER>Ron</PER>, however, spoke to Black.
“You will damage  that leg even more.”   “Did you hear me?” <PER>Ron</PER> said weakly, though he was  clinging painfully to <PER>Harry</PER> to stay upright.
“Why’s that?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat, trying to wrench himself  free of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
... What’s the matter, gone soft in  Azkaban?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whimpered.
“Be quiet!”   “HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared, and  with a huge effort he broke free of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s restraint and lunged forward —   He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that  he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black  was a tall, full-grown man — all <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that  he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and  that he didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —   Perhaps it was the shock of <PER>Harry</PER> doing something so  stupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in time —  one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands fastened over his wasted wrist,  forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of <PER>Harry</PER>’s  other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and  they fell, backward, into the wall —   <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming; <PER>Ron</PER> was yelling; there was  a blinding flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a  jet of sparks into the air that missed <PER>Harry</PER>’s face by  inches; <PER>Harry</PER> felt the shrunken arm under his fingers  twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand  punching every part of Black it could find.
But Black’s free hand had found <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat —   “No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long — ”       The fingers tightened, <PER>Harry</PER> choked, his glasses  askew.
Black let go of <PER>Harry</PER> with a grunt of pain; <PER>Ron</PER> had  thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and <PER>Harry</PER>  heard a faint clatter —   He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own  wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward  it but —   “Argh!”   Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front  claws had sunk themselves deep into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm;  <PER>Harry</PER> threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted  toward <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand —   “NO YOU DONT!” roared <PER>Harry</PER>, and he aimed a kick  at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside,  spitting; <PER>Harry</PER> snatched up his wand and turned —   “Get out of the way!” he shouted at <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, gasping for  breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching  up her and <PER>Ron</PER>’s wands.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s ragged breathing  came from near the bed; <PER>Hermione</PER> was quite silent.
“WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK!”   Black made a startled movement that almost  dislodged Crookshanks; <PER>Harry</PER> gripped his wand  convulsively — Do it nouA said a voice in his head —  but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and  <PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t done it.
His eyes flickered over <PER>Ron</PER>,  lying on the floor, over <PER>Hermione</PER>, cowering next to the  door, to <PER>Harry</PER>, standing there with his wand covering         Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and  bleeding at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did  the two <PER>Hermione</PER> was holding.
Mystified, <PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked  bewildered.
“You — you — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER> — ”   “ — you and him!”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, calm down — ”   “I didn’t tell anyone!” <PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked.
Then, with an obvious effort, he  turned to <PER>Hermione</PER> and said, “How long have you  known?”   “Ages,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met,  <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   “I’m not,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“At least, the  staff do.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hired you when he knew you were a  werewolf?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped.
Look — ”   He separated <PER>Harry</PER>’s, <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wands  and threw each back to its owner; <PER>Harry</PER> caught his,  stunned.
I’m Moony —  that was my friends’ nickname for me at school.”   “You wrote — ?”   “The important thing is, I was watching it carefully  this evening, because I had an idea that you, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> might try and sneak out of the castle to  visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> before his hippogriff was executed.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> voiced what <PER>Harry</PER>  was thinking.
And <PER>Harry</PER> — you owe <PER>Harry</PER>  the truth, Sirius!”   Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes  were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly  under <PER>Ron</PER>’s bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands.
...”   “You’re nutters, both of you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> shakily,  looking round at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for support.
“Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.”   “HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled,  trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but  Scabbers was fighting too hard; <PER>Ron</PER> swayed and       overbalanced, and <PER>Harry</PER> caught him and pushed him  back down to the bed.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s holding him, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Ron</PER>, and as their eyes met,  they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out  of their minds.
And I looked them  up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic  keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become      animals; there’s a register showing what animal they  become, and their markings and things ... and I went  and looked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> up on the register,  and there have been only seven Animagi this century,  and Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the list — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the  effort <PER>Hermione</PER> put into her homework, when Lupin  started to laugh.
<PER>Ron</PER> started to interrupt,  but <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Shh!” She was watching Lupin  very intently.
James was Prongs.”         “What sort of animal — ?” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but <PER>Hermione</PER>  cut him off.
so, in a way, <PER>Snape</PER>’s been right about me all along.”         “<PER>Snape</PER>?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off  Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up  at Lupin.
“He’s teaching  here as well.” He looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
...”   “Severus was very interested in where I went every  month.” Lupin told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Well, of course, <PER>Snape</PER> tried it  — if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a  fully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard  what Sirius had done, went after <PER>Snape</PER> and pulled  him back, at great risk to his life .
...”   “So that’s why <PER>Snape</PER> doesn’t like you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  slowly, “because he thought you were in on the joke?”   “That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall  behind Lupin.
“You haven’t heard everything — I can  explain — Sirius is not here to kill <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his eyes  now gleaming fanatically.
With a roar of rage,   Black started toward <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> pointed his  wand straight between Black’s eyes.
He glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, took an uncertain step toward  <PER>Snape</PER> and said, in a very breathless voice, “Professor      <PER>Snape</PER> — it — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve  got to say, w — would it?”   “Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension  from this school,” <PER>Snape</PER> spat.
“The  rat — look at the rat — ”   But there was a mad glint in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s eyes that <PER>Harry</PER>  had never seen before.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had  tried to disarm <PER>Snape</PER> at exactly the same moment.
... We attacked a teacher ... ,”  <PER>Hermione</PER> whimpered, staring at the lifeless <PER>Snape</PER>  with frightened eyes.
I mean ...” He looked up at <PER>Harry</PER> and       <PER>Hermione</PER> for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could  turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he  supposed to know which one he’s after if he was  locked up in Azkaban?”   “You know, Sirius, that’s a fair question,” said Lupin,  turning to Black and frowning slightly.
It was the photograph of <PER>Ron</PER> and his family that had  appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer,  and there, on <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulder, was Scabbers.
“Then I should’ve let <PER>Snape</PER> take you!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
<PER>Ron</PER>, give me that rat”   “What are you going to do with him if I give him to  you?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked Lupin tensely.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
I suppose <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>  taught him a few tricks!”   Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh  that filled the whole room.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> went to the  Potters’ on your information ... and <PER>Voldemort</PER> met his  downfall there.
It must have been  the finest moment of your miserable life, telling  <PER>Voldemort</PER> you could hand him the Potters.”       Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; <PER>Harry</PER> caught  words like “far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he couldn’t  help paying more attention to the ashen color of  Pettigrew’s face and the way his eyes continued to  dart toward the windows and door.
If  he’s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never  tried to hurt <PER>Harry</PER> before now?”   “There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at <PER>Ron</PER> with  his maimed hand.
If he  gave them <PER>Harry</PER>, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>?
You won’t let them kill me, <PER>Ron</PER>, will you ... you’re on  my side, aren’t you?”   But <PER>Ron</PER> was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost  revulsion.
“<PER>Harry</PER> ... <PER>Harry</PER> ... you look just like your father ...  just like him.
... <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> forced me —     “DONT LIE!” bellowed Black.
He  can go to Azkaban ... but don’t kill him.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms  around <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees.
“Stand aside, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
You  agree, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor  and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I  can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey,  so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we  can get you to the hospital wing.”   He hurried over to <PER>Ron</PER>, bent down, tapped <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg  with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages  spun up <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.
“Thanks.”       “What about Professor <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a  small voice, looking down at <PER>Snape</PER>’s prone figure.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  brought up the rear.
<PER>Harry</PER> went right after Black, who was still  making <PER>Snape</PER> drift along ahead of them; he kept  bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling.
Black saw <PER>Snape</PER> up through the hole, then stood  back for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to pass.
<PER>Snape</PER> collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Ron</PER>, who  had stopped abruptly.
He flung out one  arm to make <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stop.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw his  bald tail whip through the manacle on <PER>Ron</PER>’s  outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the  grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; <PER>Harry</PER> turned  to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into  the forest —   “Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” <PER>Harry</PER>  yelled.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> dashed over to <PER>Ron</PER>.
He had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing  they could do for <PER>Ron</PER> at the moment, and by the  sound of it, Black was in trouble —   <PER>Harry</PER> set off at a run, <PER>Hermione</PER> right behind him.
...   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, think of something happy!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled,  raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear  his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint  screaming that had started inside it —   I’m going to live with my godfather.
They formed a solid wall  around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and were getting closer.
At the same moment, <PER>Harry</PER> felt         <PER>Hermione</PER> collapse next to him.
... I’m afraid  it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ...  and of course Potter has always been allowed an  extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster —     “Ah, well, <PER>Snape</PER> ... <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, you know ... we’ve  all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned.”   “And yet — is it good for him to be given so much  special treatment?
“How’s <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
The dementors will be performing the kiss any  moment now — ”   “WHAT?”   <PER>Harry</PER> jumped up out of bed; <PER>Hermione</PER> had done the  same.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking  agitated.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’re very confused, you’ve been  through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve  got everything under control.
“YOU VE GOT THE  WRONG MAN!”   “Minister, listen, please,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said; she had  hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>’s side and was gazing imploringly  into Fudge’s face.
It was <PER>Ron</PER>’s rat,  he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and — ”   “You see, Minister?” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Something  about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ”   “That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  surveying <PER>Snape</PER> closely through his half-moon  spectacles.
“You didn’t arrive in time to  hear — ”   “Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!”   “Now, <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is  disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances — ”   “I would like to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> abruptly.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, 111 see you  upstairs.”   He crossed to the door and held it open for <PER>Snape</PER>,  but <PER>Snape</PER> hadn’t moved.
“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?”  <PER>Snape</PER> whispered, his eyes fixed on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  face.
“I wish to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone,”  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated.
<PER>Snape</PER> took a step toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
It closed behind them,  and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw  Pettigrew — ”   “ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a  werewolf — ”       “ — he’s a rat — ”     “ — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off     “ — Pettigrew attacked <PER>Ron</PER>, it wasn’t Sirius — ”   But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> held up his hand to stem the flood of  explanations.
You must see that Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s version of  events is far more convincing than yours.”   “He hates Sirius,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said desperately.
“What we need,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, and his  light blue eyes moved from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “is  more time.”   “But — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
Good luck.”   “Good luck?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated as the door closed  behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, what — ?”   “In here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and dragged  him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she  opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and  mops, then slammed the door behind them.
“What — how — <PER>Hermione</PER>, what happened?”   “We’ve gone back in time,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered,  lifting the chain off <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck in the darkness.
“Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it’s us going  down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s!”   “Are you telling me,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, “that we’re  here in this cupboard and we’re out there too?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her ear still glued to the  cupboard door.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on an upturned bucket, looking  desperately anxious, but <PER>Harry</PER> wanted a few  questions answered.
“Where did you get that hourglass thing?”   “It’s called a Time-Turner,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “and  I got it from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> on our first day  back.
But ...   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t understand what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants us  to do.
...”   “This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we’re going to save Buckbeak!”   “But — how will that help Sirius?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said — he just told us where the  window is — the window of Flitwick’s office!
Sirius  can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together!”   From what <PER>Harry</PER> could see of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s face, she  looked terrified.
We must be  nearly at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s by now!”   Still working out what she meant, <PER>Harry</PER> set off at a  sprint, <PER>Hermione</PER> behind him.
Safe in the shadows of the trees, <PER>Harry</PER> turned  around; seconds later, <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived beside him,  panting.
“That’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> breaking the milk jug,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  whispered.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly, “what if we — we  just run in there and grab Pettigrew — ”   “No!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a terrified whisper.
You heard <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, if we’re  seen — ”   “We’d only be seen by ourselves and <PER>Hagrid</PER>!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, what do you think you’d do if you saw  yourself bursting into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
And sure enough, moments later, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s back door  opened, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  walking out of it with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Then he turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’  all!”       <PER>Harry</PER> watched the <PER>Hermione</PER> in the pumpkin patch  throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and <PER>Ron</PER>.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone ... but  the <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hidden in the trees could  now hear what was happening inside the cabin  through the back door.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face  appeared at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s window, staring out at  Buckbeak.
“Wait here,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could still hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s voice talking from  within the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked  over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight;  they couldn’t see <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s garden at all.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the  hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> tightened  their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to  stop him.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> listened closely.
“There’s <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched himself and <PER>Hermione</PER>  chasing after <PER>Ron</PER>.
They saw him bowl <PER>Harry</PER> over, then seize <PER>Ron</PER>.
...   “Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  watching the dog pulling <PER>Ron</PER> into the roots.
“If only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had come with us ...”   “Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  bitterly.
“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, <PER>Snape</PER>’d  never be able to get it and — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, we mustn’t be seen!”   “How can you stand this?” he asked <PER>Hermione</PER>  fiercely.
“I’m going to grab the cloak!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, no!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> seized the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes not a  moment too soon.
No,  Buckbeak).”   The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to  <PER>Hagrid</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> seized his rope too, straining to  hold Buckbeak back.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s fists clenched as they watched <PER>Snape</PER> skid to  a halt next to the tree, looking around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s mouth was slightly open by the time  <PER>Harry</PER> had finished.
“I think it was my dad.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced up at <PER>Hermione</PER> and saw that her  mouth was fully open now.
Next  came <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Black.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered as though she knew  exactly what he was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put.
“He’s  transforming — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
The dementors will be coming any moment —         “Back to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s!” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
The cabin was in sight; <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to the door,  wrenched it open, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and Buckbeak  flashed past him; <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself in after them  and bolted the door.
“But if we don’t see what’s going on, how’re  we going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?”   “Well ... okay, then ... I’ll wait here with Buckbeak ...  but <PER>Harry</PER>, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there  — and the dementors — ”       <PER>Harry</PER> stepped outside again and edged around the  cabin.
Does that make sense?”   “I don’t know — <PER>Harry</PER>, look at <PER>Snape</PER>!”   Together they peered around the bush at the other  bank.
He was  conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Black onto them.
This is it, <PER>Hermione</PER> — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and  <PER>Harry</PER> gave her a leg up.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was       holding <PER>Harry</PER> very tight around the waist; he could  hear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I  really don’t like this — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> urged Buckbeak forward.
“Stand back!” <PER>Hermione</PER> called to him, and she took  out her wand, still gripping the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes  with her left hand.
Buckbeak landed with a clatter on  the battlements, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> slid off him  at once.
“How can I ever thank — ”   “GO!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted together.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> jumped back as the enormous wings  rose once more.
OWL POST AGAIN     “<PER>Harry</PER>!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her  watch.
“We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back  down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us  — before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> locks the door — ”   “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wrenching his gaze from the sky,  “let’s go.
"... only hope <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s not going to make  difficulties,” <PER>Snape</PER> was saying.
...I daresay they’ll want to interview you, <PER>Snape</PER> ...  and once young <PER>Harry</PER>’s back in his right mind, I  expect he’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you  saved him.
He caught a glimpse of  <PER>Snape</PER>’s smirk as he and Fudge passed <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hiding place.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> waited a few moments to make  sure they’d really gone, then started to run in the  opposite direction.
“Peeves\” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, grabbing <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wrist.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back  inside — before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> locks the door?” <PER>Harry</PER>  panted.
“Okay — I can hear  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tensely.
Panicking,  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran forward.
“Yes, I think you’ve  gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped back inside the  dormitory.
As the lock clicked  behind them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> crept back to their  own beds, <PER>Hermione</PER> tucking the Time-Turner back  under her robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly.
Fudge, <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came striding into the  ward.
“This  door’s been locked, we just saw — ”   “THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” <PER>Snape</PER>  howled, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Unless you are suggesting that <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> are able to be in two places at once, I’m  afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.”   <PER>Snape</PER> stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who  looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to       <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, whose eyes were twinkling behind his  glasses.
“I’d watch out for him if I were you,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> would like that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling at  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
What’s going on?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
When <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the hospital  wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost  deserted castle.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER>  nor <PER>Hermione</PER> felt like going, however, so they and  <PER>Harry</PER> wandered onto the grounds, still talking about  the extraordinary events of the previous night and  wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.
Bin celebratin’ all  night!”         “That’s wonderful!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving <PER>Ron</PER> a  reproving look because he looked as though he was  close to laughing.
“Why?”   “Leavin’, isn’ he?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking surprised that  <PER>Harry</PER> had to ask.
“I’m going to see him,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I just saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, while <PER>Harry</PER> was trying  to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin  said, “From what the headmaster told me this  morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, <PER>Harry</PER>.
It’s no use to me, and I daresay you, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> will find uses for it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> took the map and grinned.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — yesterday, when I was  having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went  very — very strange.”   “Indeed?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...  She said the servant would help him come back to  power.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
That makes it my fault if <PER>Voldemort</PER>  comes back!”     “It does not,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
When one  wizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a certain  bond between them ... and I’m much mistaken if  <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants his servant in the debt of <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter.”   “I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked as though he knew what <PER>Harry</PER>  was thinking.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t laugh  — he could tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> .
Prongs rode again last night.”   It took a moment for <PER>Harry</PER> to realize what  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said.
... You found him inside  yourself.”   And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left the office, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to his  very confused thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had  happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and  Pettigrew had vanished except <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
But the thing  that was lowering <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits most of all was the  prospect of returning to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had passed every subject.
He had a shrewd suspicion that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might  have stepped in to stop <PER>Snape</PER> failing him on purpose.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s behavior toward <PER>Harry</PER> over the past week  had been quite alarming.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have  thought it possible that <PER>Snape</PER>’s dislike for him could  increase, but it certainly had.
A muscle twitched  unpleasantly at the corner of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thin mouth  every time he looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, and he was constantly  flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them  around <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat.
Even <PER>Harry</PER> managed to forget         about the journey back to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s the next day  as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the  next morning, <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> some  surprising news.
“Oh, cheer up, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sadly.
I know how  to use a fellytone now — ”       “A telephone, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
...”   Feeling considerably more cheerful, <PER>Harry</PER> joined <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> in several games of Exploding Snap,  and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he  bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing  with chocolate in it.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, peering over his  shoulder.
He ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s from  Sirius!”   “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
“That’ll be good enough for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>  happily.
He looked closely at  the owl for a moment; then, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s and  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s great surprise, he held him out for  Crookshanks to sniff.
It was still  clutched tightly in his hand as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> stepped back through the barrier of  platform nine and three-quarters.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled after <PER>Harry</PER>  as <PER>Harry</PER> bid him and <PER>Hermione</PER> good-bye, then  wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s  cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his  usual fashion.
“It could be done without <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, My Lord.”   Another pause, more protracted, and then —   “Without <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” breathed the second voice  softly.
“Laying hands on <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a  substitute?
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE SCAR   <PER>Harry</PER> lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though  he had been running.
...  All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that at the moment when  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chair had swung around, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>,  had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of  horror, which had awoken him ... or had that been  the pain in his scar?
... <PER>Voldemort</PER> and  Wormtail had been talking about someone they had  killed, though <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember the name .
No, the thing that was bothering <PER>Harry</PER> was that the  last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been close by.
Asleep was the way <PER>Harry</PER> liked the <PER>Dursley</PER>s best; it  wasn’t as though they were ever any help to him  awake.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER> were  <PER>Harry</PER>’s only living relatives.
And yet it was because of <PER>Voldemort</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had  come to live with the <PER>Dursley</PER>s in the first place.
If it  hadn’t been for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have had  the lightning scar on his forehead.
If it hadn’t been for  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would still have had parents.
...   <PER>Harry</PER> had been a year old the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> —  the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard  who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years  — arrived at his house and killed his father and  mother.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had then turned his wand on  <PER>Harry</PER>; he had performed the curse that had disposed  of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady  rise to power — and, incredibly, it had not worked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had survived with  nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead,  and <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been reduced to something barely  alive.
His powers gone, his life almost extinguished,  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had fled; the terror in which the secret  community of witches and wizards had lived for so  long had lifted, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s followers had disbanded,  and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter had become famous.
As for informing the  headmaster, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  went during the summer holidays.
Wherever  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was, though, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that  Hedwig would be able to find him; <PER>Harry</PER>’s owl had  never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even  without an address.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, <PER>Ron</PER>  Weasley’s, reaction, and in a moment, <PER>Ron</PER>’s red hair  and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before  <PER>Harry</PER>, wearing a bemused expression.
In any case, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the idea of the  whole Weasley family knowing that he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was  getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain.
Mrs.  Weasley would fuss worse than <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Fred  and George, <PER>Ron</PER>’s sixteen-year-old twin brothers,  might think <PER>Harry</PER> was losing his nerve.
The Weasleys  were <PER>Harry</PER>’s favorite family in the world; he was  hoping that they might invite him to stay any time  now (<PER>Ron</PER> had mentioned something about the  Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want  his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his  scar.
<PER>Harry</PER>,   <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew otherwise, however; they  had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the  previous year, though only Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  believed their story.
For one glorious hour, <PER>Harry</PER> had believed that he was  leaving the <PER>Dursley</PER>s at last, because Sirius had  offered him a home once his name had been cleared.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s had never allowed  this before; their general wish of keeping <PER>Harry</PER> as  miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his  powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the  cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.
But their attitude had changed since they had found  out that <PER>Harry</PER> had a dangerous murderer for a  godfather — for <PER>Harry</PER> had conveniently forgotten to  tell them that Sirius was innocent.
Sirius’s letters, which were  now hidden beneath the highly useful loose  floorboard under <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, sounded cheerful, and  in both of them he had reminded <PER>Harry</PER> to call on him  if ever <PER>Harry</PER> needed to.
<PER>Harry</PER>   Yes, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, that looked all right.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      3      THE INVITATION   By the time <PER>Harry</PER> arrived in the kitchen, the three  <PER>Dursley</PER>s were already seated around the table.
When Aunt  Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto  <PER>Dudley</PER>’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy  darling,” <PER>Dudley</PER> glowered at her.
The diet  sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school  nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been  emptied of all <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite things — fizzy drinks  and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled  instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of  things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.” To  make <PER>Dudley</PER> feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had  insisted that the whole family follow the diet too.
Aunt Petunia  seemed to feel that the best way to keep up <PER>Dudley</PER>’s  morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get  more to eat than <PER>Harry</PER>.
(<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t touched these; he had had too  much experience of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cooking.)
And then on  <PER>Harry</PER>’s birthday (which the <PER>Dursley</PER>s had completely  ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes,  one each from <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and Sirius.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then  nodded pointedly at <PER>Dudley</PER>, who had already finished  his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing <PER>Harry</PER>’s  with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.
About you.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER>’s confusion increased.
Uncle Vernon glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, then looked down at  the letter and began to read aloud:   Dear Mr. and Mrs. <PER>Dursley</PER>,   We have never been introduced, but I am sure you  have heard a great deal from <PER>Harry</PER> about my son <PER>Ron</PER>.
Other people might not  understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss  about too many stamps, but <PER>Harry</PER> had lived with the  <PER>Dursley</PER>s too long not to know how touchy they were  about anything even slightly out of the ordinary.
Allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to go  would make <PER>Harry</PER> happy, something Uncle Vernon  had struggled against for thirteen years.
On the other  hand, allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to disappear to the Weasleys’ for  the rest of the summer would get rid of him two  weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and  Uncle Vernon hated having <PER>Harry</PER> in the house.
Nobody ever  mentioned the name of <PER>Harry</PER>’s school aloud in the  <PER>Dursley</PER> household.
“You stand there, in the  clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful  back — ”   “Only after <PER>Dudley</PER> finished with them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so  large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      five times so as to be able to use his hands, and  which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.
If he tried to  stop <PER>Harry</PER> writing to Sirius, Sirius would think <PER>Harry</PER>  was being mistreated.
If he told <PER>Harry</PER> he couldn’t go  to the Quidditch World Cup, <PER>Harry</PER> would write and  tell Sirius, who would know <PER>Harry</PER> was being  mistreated.
Outside in the hall he nearly ran into <PER>Dudley</PER>, who  had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to  overhear <PER>Harry</PER> being told off.
“I feel really full, don’t you?”   Laughing at the astonished look on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s face,  <PER>Harry</PER> took the stairs three at a time, and hurled  himself back into his bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “OUCH!” said <PER>Harry</PER> as what appeared to be a small,  gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his  head.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down, recognized <PER>Ron</PER>’s handwriting,  then tore open the envelope.
See you soon —        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Ron</PER>     “Calm down!” <PER>Harry</PER> said as the small owl flew low  over his head, twittering madly with what <PER>Harry</PER> could  only assume was pride at having delivered the letter  to the right person.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized his eagle-feather quill once more,  grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote:   <PER>Ron</PER>, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      If you want to contact me, I’ll be at my friend <PER>Ron</PER>  Weasley’s for the rest of the summer.
“I’ll be at <PER>Ron</PER>’s when you get back, all right?” <PER>Harry</PER>  told her.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        BACK TO THE BURROW   By twelve o’clock the next day, <PER>Harry</PER>’s school trunk  was packed with his school things and all his most  prized possessions — the Invisibility Cloak he had  inherited from his father, the broomstick he had  gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he  had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t bothered about  what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious  about how rude the <PER>Dursley</PER>s might be to the  Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst  idea of wizards.
<PER>Harry</PER>  couldn’t take the tension; he left the room and went  and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement  and nerves.
George, no, there’s no room, go back quickly and tell  <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “Maybe <PER>Harry</PER> can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able  to let us out — ”   There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards  behind the electric fire.
<PER>Harry</PER>, can you hear us?”   The <PER>Dursley</PER>s rounded on <PER>Harry</PER> like a pair of angry  wolverines.
“What’s going  on?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,”  said <PER>Harry</PER>, fighting a mad desire to laugh.
...  Let’s think ... ouch, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice now joined the others’.
Stand back,  <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> retreated to the sofa.
I’ll light a fire to send the boys  back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I  Disapparate.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was ready to bet that the <PER>Dursley</PER>s hadn’t  understood a single word of this.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected that Fred and George  were hoping for a glimpse of <PER>Dudley</PER>; they had heard a  lot about him from <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could  hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew  that the sounds had scared <PER>Dudley</PER> out of the kitchen.
“Yep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that’s <PER>Dudley</PER>.”   He and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged glances and then quickly  looked away from each other; the temptation to burst  out laughing was almost overwhelming.
Indeed, from  the tone of his voice when he next spoke, <PER>Harry</PER> was  quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought <PER>Dudley</PER> was quite        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      as mad as the <PER>Dursley</PER>s thought he was, except that  Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the <PER>Dursley</PER>s draw back against  the wall as one.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his  pocket, then gave the <PER>Dursley</PER>s a cheery wave,  stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying  “the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering  gasp.
“See you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> brightly to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
“Well ... T>ye then,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
One bewildered second  later, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the foot-long thing was  <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee  wrapper lay on the floor before him.
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside  <PER>Dudley</PER>, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and  attempted to wrench it out of his mouth;  unsurprisingly, <PER>Dudley</PER> yelled and sputtered worse  than ever, trying to fight her off.
“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled,  advancing on <PER>Dudley</PER> with his wand outstretched, but  Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      herself on top of <PER>Dudley</PER>, shielding him from Mr.  Weasley.
“It’s a  simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred —  real practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement  Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct     it — ”     But far from being reassured, the <PER>Dursley</PER>s became  more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing  hysterically, tugging <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue as though  determined to rip it out; <PER>Dudley</PER> appeared to be  suffocating under the combined pressure of his  mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had  lost control completely, seized a china figure from on  top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr.  Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to  shatter in the blasted fireplace.
He stepped into the fire, looking over his  shoulder as he said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting  glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting  a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with his  wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of  <PER>Dudley</PER>, and <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue lolling around like a  great slimy python.
But next moment <PER>Harry</PER> had      begun to spin very fast, and the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ living room  was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green  flames.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      5      WEASLEYS’ WIZARD WHEEZES   <PER>Harry</PER> spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to  his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until  he started to feel sick and closed his eyes.
...”   The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; <PER>Harry</PER> looked  around and saw that <PER>Ron</PER> and George were sitting at  the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people  <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before, though he knew      immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the  two eldest Weasley brothers.
“How’re you doing, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said the nearer of the two,  grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which  <PER>Harry</PER> shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his  fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER>  knew that he worked for the wizarding bank,  Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at  Hogwarts; <PER>Harry</PER> had always imagined Bill to be an  older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and  fond of bossing everyone around.
“Isn’t he, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said <PER>Harry</PER> earnestly.
One, with very bushy  brown hair and rather large front teeth, was <PER>Harry</PER>’s  and <PER>Ron</PER>’s friend, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
The other, who  was small and red-haired, was <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister,  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Both of them smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, who grinned  back, which made <PER>Ginny</PER> go scarlet — she had been  very taken with <PER>Harry</PER> ever since his first visit to the  Burrow.
“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard  Wheezes — ”   “Why don’t you show <PER>Harry</PER> where he’s sleeping,   <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> from the doorway.
“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “in my  room, he slept there last — ”   “We can all go,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> pointedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> edged out of the kitchen, and they,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> set off along the narrow hallway  and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through  the house to the upper stories.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both laughed, although <PER>Hermione</PER>  didn’t.
“You might sneer, <PER>Ron</PER>,” he said heatedly, “but unless  some sort of international law is imposed we might  well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-  bottomed products that seriously endanger — ”   “Yeah, yeah, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he started off  upstairs again.
As <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> up       three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen  below echoed up to them.
The room at the top of the house where <PER>Ron</PER> slept  looked much as it had the last time that <PER>Harry</PER> had  come to stay: the same posters of <PER>Ron</PER>’s favorite  Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling  and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the  fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously  held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large  frog.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but  instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered  <PER>Ron</PER>’s letter to <PER>Harry</PER> in Privet Drive.
“Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because  he’s got to work.”   “Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> named him,” he explained to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> too well to take him       seriously.
“Where’s Crookshanks?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> now.
They 11 be announcing their  engagement any day now.”   “Have you had a good summer, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“They saved my life,  those cakes.”   “And have you heard from — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but at a  look from <PER>Hermione</PER> he fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER>  had been about to ask about Sirius.
<PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had been so deeply involved in helping  Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they  were almost as concerned about <PER>Harry</PER>’s godfather as  he was.
Nobody but themselves and Professor        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew about how Sirius had escaped, or  believed in his innocence.
“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, to  cover the awkward moment, because <PER>Ginny</PER> was  looking curiously from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Knives and  forks, please, you two,” she said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>,  pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she  had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which  shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off  the walls and ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both jumped out of  the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across  the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which  had just been tipped back into the sink by the  dustpan.
“C’mon,” <PER>Ron</PER> said hurriedly to <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing a  handful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and  help Bill and Charlie.”   They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door  into the yard.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      They had only gone a few paces when <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting  out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the  air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs.
Fred and George were cheering, <PER>Ginny</PER> was laughing,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> was hovering near the hedge,  apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.
By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under  dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking,       and the nine Weasleys, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-  blue sky.
As you know,  we’ve got another big event to organize right after the  World Cup.”   Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down  toward the end of the table where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting.
“The top-  secret one.”   <PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes and muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, “He’s been trying to get us to ask what that  event is ever since he started work.
Flying came more naturally to <PER>Harry</PER> than anything        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      else in the magical world, and he played in the  position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked carefully up the table to check that the  rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said  very quietly to <PER>Harry</PER>, “So — have you heard from  Sirius lately?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked around, listening closely.
He might write back while I’m  here.”   He suddenly remembered the reason he had written  to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about his scar hurting again, and  about the dream that had awoken him .
“We sent it.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling         THE PORTKEY   <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep  in <PER>Ron</PER>’s room when he was being shaken awake by  Mrs. Weasley.
“Time to go, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear,” she whispered, moving  away to wake <PER>Ron</PER>.
“We’re  supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, smiling, “very good.”   “Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said  George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.
“He’s  been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just  to prove he can.”   There were footsteps down the passageway and  <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> came into the kitchen, both  looking pale and drowsy.
“I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along  around midday,” Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as  he, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> set off across  the dark yard after Fred and George.
...” Amos  Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three  Weasley boys, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“This is <PER>Hermione</PER>, friend of  <PER>Ron</PER>’s — and <PER>Harry</PER>, another friend — ”   “Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes  widening.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   “Er — yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
... You  beat <PER>Harry</PER> Potterl”   <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he  remained silent.
...”   He looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
...   “Three ...” muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his  watch, “two ... one ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      It happened immediately: <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a hook  just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked  irresistibly forward.
His feet left the ground; he could  feel <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> on either side of him, their  shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding  forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his  forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was  pulling him magnetically onward and then —   His feet slammed into the ground; <PER>Ron</PER> staggered into  him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near  his head with a heavy thud.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      7      BAGMAN AND CROUCH   <PER>Harry</PER> disentangled himself from <PER>Ron</PER> and got to his  feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games  and Sports,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, looking surprised.
Here,  <PER>Harry</PER>, where do you reckon we should start?”   <PER>Harry</PER> had never been camping in his life; the  <PER>Dursley</PER>s had never taken him on any kind of holiday,  preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old  neighbor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have  spotted this problem too; she gave <PER>Harry</PER> a quizzical  look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees  and entered the first tent.
...”   “There’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave  us,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had followed <PER>Harry</PER> inside the tent  and seemed completely unimpressed by its  extraordinary inner proportions.
“It’s on the other  side of the field.”   “Well, why don’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> go and get  us some water then” — Mr. Weasley handed over the  kettle and a couple of saucepans — “and the rest of  us will get some wood for a fire?”   “But we’ve got an oven,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
After a quick tour of the girls’ tent, which was slightly  smaller than the boys’, though without the smell of  cats, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off across the  campsite with the kettle and saucepans.
It was only just  dawning on <PER>Harry</PER> how many witches and wizards        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      there must be in the world; he had never really  thought much about those in other countries.
A Ministry wizard had  already spotted them; as he hurried past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> he muttered distractedly, “In broad  daylight!
You’ll be supporting  Ireland, of course?” she added, eyeing <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> beadily.
When they had assured her  that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off  again, though, as <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Like we’d say anything  else surrounded by that lot.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all  over their tents?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined  it, right behind a pair of men who were having a  heated argument.
Oliver Wood, the old captain of <PER>Harry</PER>’s House  Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged  <PER>Harry</PER> over to his parents’ tent to introduce him, and  told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the  Puddlemere United reserve team.
More to  stop <PER>Ron</PER> from smirking than anything, <PER>Harry</PER>  hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers  whom he had never seen before.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> kindly,  taking the box from him, and showing him how to do  it properly.
Mr.  Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for  <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s benefit; his own children  knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly  interested.
He’s just started at the Ministry — and  this is Fred — no, George, sorry — that’s Fred — Bill,  Charlie, <PER>Ron</PER> — my daughter, <PER>Ginny</PER> — and <PER>Ron</PER>’s  friends, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”   Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he  heard <PER>Harry</PER>’s name, and his eyes performed the  familiar flick upward to the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,”  <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as they and <PER>Hermione</PER> strolled through  the salesmen, buying souvenirs.
Bargain — ten Galleons each.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Wish I hadn’t bought this now,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gesturing  at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at  the Omnioculars.
“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” <PER>Harry</PER>  told him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands.
“Oooh, thanks, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had set Dobby free  from his old owners, the <PER>Malfoy</PER> family.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  spun around in their seats to look.
“You is surely <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”       “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
I is not liking  heights at all, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter” — she glanced toward the  edge of the box and gulped — “but my master sends  me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”   “Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like  heights?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, frowning.
“I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose  again ... and again ... and again ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through  her velvet-covered, tasseled program.
... Good job too, these  Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the  best places ... ah, and here’s Lucius!”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned quickly.
Edging  along the second row to three still-empty seats right  behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the  house-elf’s former owners: Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>; his son,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>; and a woman <PER>Harry</PER> supposed must be <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been enemies ever since  their very first journey to Hogwarts.
Or our son,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>?”   “How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling  and bowing to Mrs. <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Mr. Weasley and Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>  looked at each other and <PER>Harry</PER> vividly recalled the  last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in  Flourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and they had had a  fight.
Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes had returned to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at  him.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what was making Mr.  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s lip curl like that.
The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s prided  themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they  considered anyone of Muggle descent, like <PER>Hermione</PER>,  second-class.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> one contemptuous look, then settled  himself between his mother and father.
“Slimy gits,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> turned to face the field again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what are you doing?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice  from a long way off.
“There you go,” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of  gold coins into <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, “for the Omnioculars!
<PER>Harry</PER> spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back  to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his  broomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls  burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black  Bludgers, and (<PER>Harry</PER> saw it for the briefest moment,  before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged  Golden Snitch.
“But Levski’s got the Quaffle!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed,  you’re going to miss things!” shouted <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air  while Troy did a lap of honor around the field.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed their descent through his  Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was     “They’re going to crash!” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER> next to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
As one, the Weasley boys and <PER>Harry</PER> stuffed their  fingers into their ears, but <PER>Hermione</PER>, who hadn’t  bothered, was soon tugging on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
How he could see where he was going,  <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying  through the air behind him, but he was drawing level  with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward  the ground again —   “They’re going to crash!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He ended it when Ireland were  a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!”   “He knew they were never going to catch up!” <PER>Harry</PER>  shouted back over all the noise, also applauding        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding  white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated  so that everyone in the stands could see the inside.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>  went into the next tent, and <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the  Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into  their bunks.
“I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the  Irish they’ve got to stop celebrating.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, who was on a top bunk above <PER>Ron</PER>, lay staring  up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow  of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead,  and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular  moves.
... <PER>Harry</PER> saw himself in robes that had his  name on the back, and imagined the sensation of  hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as  Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium,  “I give you ... PotteA.”   <PER>Harry</PER> never knew whether or not he had actually  dropped off to sleep — his fantasies of flying like  Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams —  all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley  was shouting.
<PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — come on now, get up, this is  urgent!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> sat up quickly and the top of his head hit  canvas.
He slipped down from the bunk and  reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had  pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No  time, <PER>Harry</PER> — just grab a jacket and get outside —  quickly!”   <PER>Harry</PER> did as he was told and hurried out of the tent,  <PER>Ron</PER> at his heels.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> came hurrying toward them,  pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr.   Weasley right behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and George followed.
“What happened?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, stopping  so abruptly that <PER>Harry</PER> walked into her.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned sharply.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing alone nearby, leaning against a  tree, looking utterly relaxed.
<PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Malfoy</PER> to do something that <PER>Harry</PER> knew he  would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley   “Language, Weasley,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his pale eyes  glittering.
Because if you do, hang around ... they’re moving this  way, and it would give us all a laugh.”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>’s a witch,” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
“Never mind, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, seizing  <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Out there wearing masks, are they?”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned his face to <PER>Harry</PER>, still smiling.
“Well ... if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you,  would I, Potter?”   “Oh come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a disgusted look  at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “let’s go and find the others.”   “Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Come on,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, and she pulled <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> up the path again.
When they saw <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, a girl with thick curly hair turned and  said quickly, “ Ou est Madame Maxime?
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  pulling out his wand, lighting it like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, and  squinting up the path.
“Ah, no, I don’t believe it ... I’ve lost my wand!”   “You’re kidding!”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands high enough to  spread the narrow beams of light farther on the  ground; <PER>Harry</PER> looked all around him, but his wand  was nowhere to be seen.
...”       “It’s people like you, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began hotly,   “who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just  because they’re too lazy to — ”   Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.
“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER> saw him glance edgily at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Perhaps  there was truth in what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said; perhaps  <PER>Hermione</PER> was in more danger than they were.
... but I’m a  vampire hunter, I’ve killed about ninety so far — ”   A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even  by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, “I’m  about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic,   I am.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> snorted with laughter.
He turned to tell <PER>Ron</PER> this, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s face had  gone oddly slack, and next second <PER>Ron</PER> was yelling,  “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach  Jupiter?”   “Honestly\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and she and <PER>Harry</PER>  grabbed <PER>Ron</PER> firmly by the arms, wheeled him around,  and marched him away.
“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting down next to <PER>Ron</PER> and watching the  small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.
“He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.”   “That’d wipe the smirk off old <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face, all right,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Those poor Muggles, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  nervously.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked quickly around too.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on, move\” <PER>Hermione</PER> had seized the  collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.
“It’s the Dark Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned,  pulling him as hard as she could.
“You-Know-Who’s  sign!”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s — ?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, come on!”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned — <PER>Ron</PER> was hurriedly scooping up his  miniature Krum — the three of them started across  the clearing — but before they had taken a few  hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced       the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air,  surrounding them.
<PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, and in an instant, he  registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his  wand out, and every wand was pointing right at  himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>” — his voice sounded shaky —  “<PER>Hermione</PER> — are you all right?”   “Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.
You seem very well informed about how that  Mark is summoned, missy — ”   But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr.  Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, or <PER>Hermione</PER> had conjured the skull; on the  contrary, at <PER>Hermione</PER>’s words, they had all raised        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      their wands again and were pointing in the direction  she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.
“Winky’s got a  squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the  incantation was much deeper!” She looked around at  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, appealing for their support.
“There’s a simple way of discovering the  last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her  ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand  again and placed it tip to tip with <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> gasp, horrified, as a gigantic  serpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where  the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the  green skull high above them; it looked as though it  were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.
Amos, that wand’s told  us all it can — if <PER>Harry</PER> could have it back, please — ”   Mr. Diggory handed <PER>Harry</PER> his wand and <PER>Harry</PER>  pocketed it.
She turned and followed <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> out of the clearing and off through the trees.
Now excuse me, please, I want to  get to bed.”   He led <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> through the crowd  and back into the campsite.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  entered after him.
With some assistance from <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened  in the woods.
... Why’s it such a big deal?”   “I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, before anyone else could answer.
“Dad, we met  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the woods, and he as good as told us  his dad was one of those nutters in masks!
And we all  know the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s were right in with You-Know-Who!”   “But what were <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s supporters — ” <PER>Harry</PER>  began.
I don’t reckon  he’d be over-pleased with them, do you?”   “So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ...” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> slowly, “were they doing it to show support  for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?”   “Your guess is as good as ours, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said Mr.  Weasley.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay looking up at  the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now  to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after  Charlie’s snores filled the tent that <PER>Harry</PER> finally dozed  off.
Weasley,” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly, unable to  contain himself, “Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter  for me, has she?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly.
“No ...  no, there hasn’t been any post at all.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked curiously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
With a  meaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I  go and dump my stuff in your room, <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “Yeah ... think I will too,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once.
“What’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, the moment they had  closed the door of the attic room behind them.
“On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar  hurting again.”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s reactions were almost exactly  as <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined them back in his bedroom on  Privet Drive.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped and started making  suggestions at once, mentioning a number of  reference books, and everybody from Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.
I can’t remember all of it now, but  they were plotting to kill ... someone.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying  “me,” but couldn’t bring himself to make <PER>Hermione</PER>  look any more horrified than she already did.
... My scar hurts, and three days later  the Death Eaters are on the march, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  sign’s up in the sky again.”   “Don’t — say — his — name!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed through  gritted teeth.
“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?”   <PER>Harry</PER> went on, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, you aren’t going to pay attention to  anything that old fraud says?”   “You weren’t there,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, <PER>Harry</PER>?”  <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
...”   “<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-  being- very- sensitive sort of voice, “<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t want  to play Quidditch right now.
“Hang on, I’ll get my Firebolt.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> left the room, muttering something that  sounded very much like “Boys.”   k k k        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much  over the following week.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was immersed in The Standard Book of  Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had  bought for her, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> was  polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit  <PER>Hermione</PER> had given him for his thirteenth birthday  open at his feet.
“A high-  ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves  unswerving obedience from his servants — ”   “His slave, you mean!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her voice rising  passionately, “because he didn’t pay Winky, did he?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that  you’ve packed properly!” said Mrs. Weasley, breaking  up the argument.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his  Firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs  with <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing a  packet across to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, you don’t reckon  Sirius has been caught, do you?”   “Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Now, mind you pack them properly so they don’t  crease.”   “Mum, you’ve given me <PER>Ginny</PER>’s new dress,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  handing it out to her.
I got some for  <PER>Harry</PER> too ... show him, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, they’re okay!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily, looking at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        ABOARD THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS   There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the  air when <PER>Harry</PER> awoke next morning.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and the  others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley  rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a  quill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending  over the fire, talking to —        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> shut his eyes hard and opened them again to  make sure that they were working properly.
“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said  Mr. Weasley to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the twins, fastening a  cloak over his shoulders and preparing to  Disapparate.
Crookshanks took quite a while to recover  from the fireworks, and by the time they entered  London, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were all severely  scratched.
They did it in groups  today; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> (the most  conspicuous, since they were accompanied by  Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned      casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly,  and slid sideways through it ... and as they did so,  platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front  of them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off to find seats,  and were soon stowing their luggage in a  compartment halfway along the train.
“It’s going to be very exciting —  mind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules — ”   “What rules?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George  together.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went back to their  compartment.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> listened,  and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in  through the open door.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> got up, tiptoed to the compartment door,  and slid it shut, blocking out <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice.
“If a Muggle looks at  it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER,  UNSAFE.”   “So Durmstrangll just look like a min to an outsider  too?”   “Maybe,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shrugging, “or it might have  Muggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup  stadium.
“Oh wow,” said <PER>Neville</PER> enviously as <PER>Ron</PER> tipped Krum  onto his pudgy hand.
“We  were in the Top Box — ”   “For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had appeared in the doorway.
“Don’t remember asking you to join us, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> coolly.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Weasley ... what is that?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, pointing at  Pigwidgeon’s cage.
<PER>Ron</PER> made to stuff the robes out of sight, but <PER>Malfoy</PER>  was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and  pulled.
“Look at this!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in ecstasy, holding up  <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley,  you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?
...”   “Eat dung, <PER>Malfoy</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, the same color as the  dress robes as he snatched them back out of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  grip.
You never miss a chance to show off,  do you?”   “Either explain what you’re on about or go away,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> testily, over the top of The  Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.
“<PER>Ron</PER>l” said <PER>Hermione</PER> reproachfully, and she pulled  out her wand, muttered “ ReparoV ’ and the glass  shards flew back into a single pane and back into the  door.
“Don’t let  <PER>Malfoy</PER> get to you, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “Him!
<PER>Hermione</PER> bundled up  Crookshanks in her cloak and <PER>Ron</PER> left his dress  robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads  bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette  at the far end of the platform.
“All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> bellowed back, waving.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> climbed gratefully into one of  them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments  later, with a great lurch, the long procession of  carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the  track toward Hogwarts Castle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> jumped down from  their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up  only when they were safely inside the cavernous,  torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble  staircase.
I’m soak — ARRGH!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from  out of the ceiling onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s head and exploded.
Drenched and sputtering, <PER>Ron</PER> staggered sideways  into <PER>Harry</PER>, just as a second water bomb dropped —  narrowly missing <PER>Hermione</PER>, it burst at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet,  sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into  his socks.
“Peeves, come down  here at ONCE!”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Deputy Headmistress and  head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of  the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and  grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> around the neck to stop herself  from falling.
“Into the Great Hall,  come on!”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped and slid across the  entrance hall and through the double doors on the  right, <PER>Ron</PER> muttering furiously under his breath as he  pushed his sopping hair off his face.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> walked past the Slytherins, the  Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with  the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall,  next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost.
“Hiya, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom <PER>Harry</PER> was  something of a hero.
Keep your fingers crossed, eh, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Er — yeah, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He turned back to  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Nearly Headless Nick.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, of  course, was still fighting his way across the lake with  the first years; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was presumably  supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      there was another empty chair too, and <PER>Harry</PER>  couldn’t think who else was missing.
On Professor  Sinistra ’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-  nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, <PER>Snape</PER> —   <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite person at Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s  loathing of <PER>Snape</PER> was matched only by <PER>Snape</PER> ’s  hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible,  intensified last year, when <PER>Harry</PER> had helped Sirius  escape right under <PER>Snape</PER> ’s overlarge nose — <PER>Snape</PER>  and Sirius had been enemies since their own school  days.
On <PER>Snape</PER> ’s other side was an empty seat, which  <PER>Harry</PER> guessed was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s.
“Oh hurry up,” <PER>Ron</PER> moaned, beside <PER>Harry</PER>, “I could  eat a hippogriff.”   The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the  doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.
If <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were wet, it was nothing to how these first  years looked.
All of them were shivering  with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed  along the staff table and came to a halt in a line  facing the rest of the school — all of them except the  smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was  wrapped in what <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  moleskin overcoat.
“Baddock, Malcolm!”   “SLYTHERIN!”   The table on the other side of the hall erupted with  cheers; <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER> clapping as Baddock       joined the Slytherins.
“Branstone, Eleanor!”   “HUFFLEPUFF!”   “Cauldwell, Owen!”   “HUFFLEPUFF!”   “Creevey, Dennis!”   Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moleskin, just as <PER>Hagrid</PER> himself sidled into  the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.
About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least  three times as broad, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, with his long, wild,  tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming  — a misleading impression, for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> to possess a very kind nature.
“ Tuck in.”   “Hear, hear!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loudly as the empty  dishes filled magically before their eyes.
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> loaded their own plates.
“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, accidentally  spraying <PER>Harry</PER> with bits of Yorkshire pudding.
“Treacle tart, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, deliberately  wafting its smell toward her.
Chocolate gateau!”   But <PER>Hermione</PER> gave him a look so reminiscent of  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> that he gave up.
He stretched out a  hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook it, muttering words <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t  hear.
“Professor Moody.”   It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with  applause, but none of the staff or students clapped  except <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who both put their  hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed  dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly  quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Moody?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
At every House table, <PER>Harry</PER> could see  people either gazing raptly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, or else  whispering fervently to their neighbors.
“Yeah, a  thousand Galleons ...”   “Come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “we’ll be the only ones left  here if you don’t move.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George set off for  the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways  in which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might stop those who were  under seventeen from entering the tournament.
...”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knows you’re not of age, though,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s trying to stop us  giving our names.”   “People have died, though!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a  worried voice as they walked through a door  concealed behind a tapestry and started up another,  narrower staircase.
Hey, <PER>Ron</PER>, what if we find out how to get ’round  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Fancy entering?”   “What d’you reckon?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> seized him under the armpits and pulled him  out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs  creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> cast the  merrily dancing flames a dark look, and <PER>Harry</PER>  distinctly heard her mutter “ Slave labor,” before  bidding them good night and disappearing through  the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> climbed up the last, spiral  staircase until they reached their own dormitory,  which was situated at the top of the tower.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> got into their pajamas and  into bed.
...   <PER>Harry</PER> grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that  <PER>Ron</PER> couldn’t see what he could.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        MAD-EYE MOODY   The storm had blown itself out by the following  morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still  gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead  as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> examined their new  course schedules at breakfast.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     “You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, buttering herself some toast.
“Then you’d be doing something sensible like  Arithmancy.”   “You’re eating again, I notice,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching  <PER>Hermione</PER> adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast  too.
A large tawny owl  soared down to <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom and deposited a  parcel into his lap — <PER>Neville</PER> almost always forgot to  pack something.
On the other side of the Hall <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder,  carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets  and cakes from home.
“Mornin’!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “On’y jus’ hatched,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly, “so yeh’ll be  able ter raise ’em yerselves!
The speaker was <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“What is the  point of them?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard;  there was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly,  “Tha’s next lesson, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Nothing but deep affection for <PER>Hagrid</PER> could have  made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pick up squelchy  handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates  to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing <PER>Hagrid</PER>  a burn on his hand.
“Eurgh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  what’s that pointy thing on it?”   “Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand  from the box).
“Dragon  blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a  dragon for a pet, would you?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who gave them a  furtive smile from behind his bushy beard.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>  would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew only too well — he  had owned one for a brief period during their first  year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of  Norbert.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “They are now,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an exasperated  voice, “but once <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s found out what they eat, I  expect they’ll be six feet long.”   “Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure  seasickness or something, will it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning  slyly at her.
“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut  <PER>Malfoy</PER> up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  began to eat so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her.
When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon  lessons, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> set off for North Tower where,  at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver  stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling,  and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked through  the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that  cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small  circular table.
<PER>Ron</PER> rolled his  eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked stonily back.
’ ”   But <PER>Hermione</PER> was right, <PER>Harry</PER> thought irritably,  Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud.
and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself  had said that he thought that trance had been  genuine, when <PER>Harry</PER> had described it to him.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>\” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
I think I am  right in saying, my dear, that you were born in  midwinter?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I was born in July.”   <PER>Ron</PER> hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.
“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> after a while,  frowning down at his piece of parchment, “that can’t  be right, can it?”   “Aaaaah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, imitating Professor Trelawney’s  mystical whisper, “when two Neptunes appear in the  sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being  born, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby,  sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask  the excited squeals from Lavender Brown — “Oh  Professor, look!
Hey, Weasley!”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> shortly.
“Get stuffed, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So tell me, is  his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?”   “You know your mother, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> — both  he and <PER>Hermione</PER> had grabbed the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s  robes to stop him from launching himself at <PER>Malfoy</PER> —  “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under  her nose?
Moody  turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER> — at least, his normal eye was  looking at <PER>Harry</PER>; the other one was pointing into the  back of his head.
“No!” cried Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, running down the  stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with  a loud snapping noise, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had reappeared,  lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair       all over his now brilliantly pink face.
... Now, your Head of House’ll  be <PER>Snape</PER>, will it?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> resentfully.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stared anxiously after them for  a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen  books, causing them to soar up into the air and back  into her arms.
“Don’t talk to me,” <PER>Ron</PER> said quietly to <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a  few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all  sides about what had just happened.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, the amazing bouncing  ferret ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both laughed, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.
“It was good, really, that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  stopped it — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously, his eyes snapping  open again, “you’re ruining the best moment of my  life!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> made an impatient noise and began to eat  at top speed again.
“We had him this  afternoon,” he told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES   The next two days passed without great incident,  unless you counted <PER>Neville</PER> melting his sixth cauldron  in Potions.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, who seemed to have  attained new levels of vindictiveness over the  summer, gave <PER>Neville</PER> detention, and <PER>Neville</PER> returned  from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been  made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.
“You know why <PER>Snape</PER> ’s in such a foul mood, don’t  you?” said <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as they watched <PER>Hermione</PER>  teaching <PER>Neville</PER> a Scouring Charm to remove the frog  guts from under his fingernails.
Indeed, whenever <PER>Harry</PER>  saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or      when they passed in the corridors — he had the  distinct impression that <PER>Snape</PER> was avoiding Moody’s  eye, whether magical or normal.
“I reckon <PER>Snape</PER>’s a bit scared of him, you know,”  <PER>Harry</PER> said thoughtfully.
“Imagine if Moody turned <PER>Snape</PER> into a horned toad,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all  around his dungeon.
Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at <PER>Ron</PER>;   <PER>Ron</PER> looked extremely apprehensive, but after a  moment Moody smiled — the first time <PER>Harry</PER> had  seen him do so.
“So ... do any of you know which curses are most  heavily punished by wizarding law?”   Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including  <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER>  felt <PER>Ron</PER> recoil slightly next to him — <PER>Ron</PER> hated  spiders.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards  being controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody,  and <PER>Harry</PER> knew he was talking about the days in  which <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been all-powerful.
Another illegal curse?”   <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand flew into the air again and so, to  <PER>Harry</PER>’s slight surprise, did <PER>Neville</PER>’s.
She was looking, not at  the spider, but at <PER>Neville</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, following her  gaze, saw that <PER>Neville</PER>’s hands were clenched upon the  desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes  wide and horrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been picturing his parents’ deaths over  and over again for three years now, ever since he’d  found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d  found out what had happened that night: Wormtail  had betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to <PER>Voldemort</PER>,  who had come to find them at their cottage.
How  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had killed <PER>Harry</PER>’s father first.
How James  Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at  his wife to take <PER>Harry</PER> and run ... <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so  that he could kill <PER>Harry</PER> .
and so <PER>Voldemort</PER> had murdered her too, before  turning his wand on <PER>Harry</PER>.
Most people were discussing the curses in awed  voices — “Did you see it twitch?” “ — and when he  killed it — just like that!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      They were talking about the lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as  though it had been some sort of spectacular show,  but he hadn’t found it very entertaining — and nor, it  seemed, had <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Hurry up,” she said tensely to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>.”   <PER>Neville</PER> was standing alone, halfway up the passage,  staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same  horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody  had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.
“<PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said gently.
I wonder what’s for  dinner, I’m — I’m starving, aren’t you?”   “<PER>Neville</PER>, are you all right?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Very interesting dinner — I  mean lesson — what’s for eating?”   <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a startled look.
No point  pretending ... well ... come on, Longbottom, I’ve got  some books that might interest you.”   <PER>Neville</PER> looked pleadingly at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, but they didn’t say anything, so <PER>Neville</PER>  had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away,  one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.
“What was that about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching <PER>Neville</PER>  and Moody turn the corner.
“Some lesson, though, eh?” said <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as they  set off for the Great Hall.
When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that  spider just died, just snuffed it right — ”   But <PER>Ron</PER> fell suddenly silent at the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s  face and didn’t speak again until they reached the       Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better  make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions  tonight, since they would take hours.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not join in with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s  conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast,  and then left for the library again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and <PER>Harry</PER>, who had  been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now  raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.
“Wouldn’t Moody and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> be in trouble with  the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?”   <PER>Harry</PER> asked as they approached the Fat Lady.
“You all right, <PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked him.
“He thought I’d like this.”   Telling <PER>Neville</PER> what Professor Sprout had said, <PER>Harry</PER>  thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering  <PER>Neville</PER> up, for <PER>Neville</PER> very rarely heard that he was  good at anything.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> took their copies of Unfogging the  Future back down to the common room, found a  table, and set to work on their predictions for the  coming month.
“You know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose hair was on end  because of all the times he had run his fingers  through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old  Divination standby.”   “What — make it up?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sweeping the jumble of scrawled  notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and  starting to write.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to  develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of  Mars and Jupiter.” He looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Crookshanks wandered over to them,  leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared  inscrutably at <PER>Harry</PER>, rather as <PER>Hermione</PER> might look if  she knew they weren’t doing their homework properly.
“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “So have I!” said <PER>Ron</PER> triumphantly, throwing down  his quill.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat down, laid the things she was carrying  in an empty armchair, and pulled <PER>Ron</PER>’s predictions  toward her.
“Funny you should ask,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a nasty  look at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, of course you haven’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly,  “I’ve only just started it.”   “Yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER> in mild surprise.
I can’t believe no  one’s done anything about it before now.”   “<PER>Hermione</PER> — open your ears,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly.
They like being enslaved!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Our short-term aims,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, speaking even  more loudly than <PER>Ron</PER>, and acting as though she  hadn’t heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair  wages and working conditions.
You’re treasurer, <PER>Ron</PER> — I’ve got you a  collecting tin upstairs — and <PER>Harry</PER>, you’re secretary,  so you might want to write down everything I’m  saying now, as a record of our first meeting.”   There was a pause in which <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed at the  pair of them, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat, torn between  exasperation at <PER>Hermione</PER> and amusement at the look  on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “She’s got an answer!” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, pointing at  the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.
<PER>Harry</PER> read it aloud:   <PER>Harry</PER> —   I’m flying north immediately.
My best to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Sirius   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who stared  back at him.
“He’s  coming back?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s reading what signs?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking  perplexed.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what’s up?”   For <PER>Harry</PER> had just hit himself in the forehead with  his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.
“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, now slamming his fist on the table so that  Hedwig landed on the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s chair, hooting  indignantly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he  been less preoccupied, <PER>Harry</PER> would have realized that  the absence of <PER>Neville</PER>’s usual snores meant that he  was not the only one lying awake.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        BEAUXBATONS AND DRUMSTRANG   Early next morning, <PER>Harry</PER> woke with a plan fully  formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had  been working on it all night.
<PER>Harry</PER>   He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through  the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who  tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the  Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.
In the end, it was <PER>Harry</PER> suggesting she might  be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask <PER>Ron</PER> to  borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg  and allow him to tie the letter to it.
“That was a lie, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply over  breakfast, when he told her and <PER>Ron</PER> what he had       done.
“He’s not going back to  Azkaban because of me.”   “Drop it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sharply to <PER>Hermione</PER> as she  opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once,  <PER>Hermione</PER> heeded him, and fell silent.
“You said — to use it  against another human was — ”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants you taught what it feels like,”  said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto <PER>Hermione</PER>  and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at each other.
They’ll have trouble controlling you!”     “The way he talks,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered as he hobbled out  of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour  later (Moody had insisted on putting <PER>Harry</PER> through       his paces four times in a row, until <PER>Harry</PER> could throw  off the curse entirely), “you’d think we were all going  to be attacked any second.”   “Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was skipping on every  alternate step.
I might  remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls  up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had turned rather pink again, seemed  to be trying not to look too pleased with herself.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were deeply amused when Professor  Trelawney told them that they had received top marks  for their homework in their next Divination class.
“I will not,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> flatly when <PER>Hagrid</PER> had  proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling  an extra- large toy out of his sack.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to  the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits;  seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> put down <PER>Malfoy</PER> was particularly  satisfying, especially because <PER>Malfoy</PER> had done his  very best to get <PER>Hagrid</PER> sacked the previous year.
“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even  perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone  from Durmstrang!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> barked at  the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during  which <PER>Neville</PER> had accidentally transplanted his own  ears onto a cactus.
Behind  the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the  Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake  united around a large letter H.   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down beside Fred and  George at the Gryffindor table.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> says the champions get awarded  points according to how well they’ve done the tasks.”   “Who are the judges?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are  always on the panel,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and everyone  looked around at her, rather surprised, “because all  three of them were injured during the Tournament of        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      1792, when a cockatrice the champions were  supposed to be catching went on the rampage.”   She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her  usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all  the books she had, “It’s all in Hogwarts, A History.
Or A Highly Biased and Selective  History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier  Aspects of the School.”   “What are you on about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER>  thought he knew what was coming.
His and <PER>Ron</PER>’s lack of enthusiasm  had done nothing whatsoever to curb <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  determination to pursue justice for house-elves.
She had been badgering <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> ever since,  first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do  the same, and she had also taken to rattling around  the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering  people and shaking the collecting tin under their  noses.
Some people, like <PER>Neville</PER>, had paid up just to stop  <PER>Hermione</PER> from glowering at them.
“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens,  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “No, of course not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> curtly, “I hardly  think students are supposed to — ”   “Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads  of times, to nick food.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  stopped talking abruptly; she and <PER>Ron</PER> watched  Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s  shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg  wearily.
Then, checking  that Fred and George were safely immersed in further  discussions about the Tri-wizard Tournament, <PER>Harry</PER>        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      read out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
When the bell rang early, <PER>Harry</PER>,   <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried up to Gryffindor Tower,  deposited their bags and books as they had been  instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back  downstairs into the entrance hall.
“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  snapped at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, standing  between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the fourth row from  the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering  with anticipation among the other first years.
...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “A Portkey?” <PER>Ron</PER> suggested.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only ever seen one person as large as this  woman in his life, and that was <PER>Hagrid</PER>; he doubted  whether there was an inch difference in their heights.
“But ze  ’orses — ”   “Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be  delighted to take care of them,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the  moment he has returned from dealing with a slight  situation that has arisen with some of his other — er  — charges.”   “Skrewts,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“I assure you that <PER>Hagrid</PER> will be well up to the job,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling.
“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going  to be?” Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around  Lavender and Parvati to address <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even <PER>Hagrid</PER>  won’t be able to handle them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s a mast!” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he  stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of  the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but his white hair was short, and his  goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide  his rather weak chin.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — it’s Krum\”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      t'fyfflapier- l6      THE GOBLET OF FIRE   “I don’t believe it!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, in a stunned voice, as  the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind  the party from Durmstrang.
Viktor  Kruml”   “For heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER>, he’s only a Quidditch  player,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     “D’you think he’d sign my hat in lipstick?”     “Really,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said loftily as they passed the  girls, now squabbling over the lipstick.
“You  haven’t got a quill, have you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, budge up, make a space — ”   “What?”   “Too late,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bitterly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could  see <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug  about this.
“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> scathingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was surprised to see  that he added four chairs, two on either side of  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “It’s French,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “I had it on holiday  summer before last.
He slid into his seat at the end and waved at <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> with a very heavily bandaged  hand.
“Skrewts doing all right, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> called.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s fingers.”   At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you  wanting ze bouillabaisse?”   It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed  during <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Ron</PER> went purple.
Perhaps <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had noticed their  sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The  casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.”   Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner  of the Hall, now approached <PER>Dumbledore</PER> carrying a  great wooden chest encrusted with jewels.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “The instructions for the tasks the champions will  face this year have already been examined by Mr.  Crouch and Mr. Bagman,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as Filch  placed the chest carefully on the table before him,   “and they have made the necessary arrangements for  each challenge.
“You’ll try  and get in, won’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> thought briefly of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s insistence that  nobody under seventeen should submit their name,  but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the  Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again.
“I notice you have dribbled food all down the  front of your robes again, disgusting boy — ”   Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the  doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were not alone in rising much  earlier than they usually did on weekends.
“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> warningly “I’m sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will have  thought of this.”   Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.
Though I must say, neither of their  beards is anything like as fine as yours.”   Fred and George set off for the hospital wing,  accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter,  and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, also chortling, went  in to breakfast.
“What’re we going to do today, then?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> when they had finished  breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.
“We haven’t been down to visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> yet,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to  donate a few fingers to the skrewts.”   A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked <PER>Hagrid</PER> to join  S.P.E.W.
“Wait for me, will  you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?”   “What is it with her?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, exasperated, as  <PER>Hermione</PER> ran away up the marble staircase.
“Hey, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t  chosen?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> as the veela-girl  dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      A loud rattling noise behind them announced  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W.
<PER>Harry</PER> knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s door, and Fang’s booming  barks answered instantly   “ ’Bout time!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, when he’d flung open the  door.
“Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!”   “We’ve been really busy, Hag — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> started to  say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  apparently lost for words.
For a moment,  <PER>Hermione</PER> goggled at him, then, obviously deciding  not to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the  skrewts?”       “Out by the pumpkin patch,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> happily.
On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each  other.”   “Oh no, really?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shooting a repressive  look at <PER>Ron</PER>, who, staring at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s odd hairstyle,  had just opened his mouth to say something about it.
Firs’ task  ... ah, but I’m not supposed ter say.”   “Go on, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> urged  him, but he just shook his head, grinning.
Never  thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament  played again!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      They ended up having lunch with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though they  didn’t eat much — <PER>Hagrid</PER> had made what he said was  a beef casserole, but after <PER>Hermione</PER> unearthed a  large talon in hers, she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> rather lost  their appetites.
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was  very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle  patter of the drops on the window, watching <PER>Hagrid</PER>  darning his socks and arguing with <PER>Hermione</PER> about  house-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W.
Yeh’d be makin’  ’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’  ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em.”   “But <PER>Harry</PER> set Dobby free, and he was over the moon  about it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
I’m not  sayin’ there isn’t the odd elf who’d take freedom, but  yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no,  nothin’ doin’, <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked very cross indeed and stuffed her  box of badges back into her cloak pocket.
By half past five it was growing dark, and <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> decided it was time to get back up to       the castle for the Halloween feast — and, more  important, the announcement of the school  champions.
Coughing,  <PER>Ron</PER> said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s that?”   “Eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, turning around with a large bottle  in his hand.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   “And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in  an undertone.
Getting to their feet very       cautiously, so that <PER>Hagrid</PER> wouldn’t spot them, <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> peered through the window and  saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons  students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly  about to set off for the feast too.
They couldn’t hear  what <PER>Hagrid</PER> was saying, but he was talking to  Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression  <PER>Harry</PER> had only ever seen him wear once before —  when he had been looking at the baby dragon,   Norbert.
<PER>Ron</PER>  watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look  around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and proceeded through  them.
“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down.
Like everyone else in the Hall, judging  by the constantly craning necks, the impatient  expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the  standing up to see whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished  eating yet, <PER>Harry</PER> simply wanted the plates to clear,  and to hear who had been selected as champions.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw  Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch  up toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; he turned right, walked along  the staff table, and disappeared through the door into  the next chamber.
“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,   “is Fleur Delacour!”   “It’s her, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted as the girl who so  resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook  back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up  between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric  Diggory!”   “No!” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, but nobody heard him except  <PER>Harry</PER>; the uproar from the next table was too great.
There was a  long pause, during which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared at the  slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared his throat  and read out —   “ <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling       THE FOUR CHAMPIONS   <PER>Harry</PER> sat there, aware that every head in the Great  Hall had turned to look at him.
Up at the top table, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had got to  her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor  Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who bent his ear toward her, frowning  slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>; beyond them, he  saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him,  openmouthed.
At the top table, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  straightened up, nodding to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Up here, if you  please!”   “Go on,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, giving <PER>Harry</PER> a slight  push.
“Well ... through the door, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
... It’s down in the  rules, you’re obliged ... <PER>Harry</PER> will just have to do the  best he — ”   The door behind them opened again, and a large  group of people came in: Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff,  Madame Maxime, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and  Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the buzzing of the  hundreds of students on the other side of the wall,  before Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed the door.
He has been crossing lines ever since he  arrived here — ”   “Thank you, Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> firmly, and  <PER>Snape</PER> went quiet, though his eyes still glinted  malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now looking down at  <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked right back at him, trying to discern  the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon  spectacles.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire,  <PER>Harry</PER>?” he asked calmly.
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet  of Fire for you?” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ignoring  <PER>Snape</PER>.
“It is possible, of course,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you know perfectly well you did not  make a mistake!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not have crossed  the line himself, and as Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  believes that he did not persuade an older student to  do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for  everybody else!”   She shot a very angry look at Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling at both of them.
Was anyone except <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> going to  believe him, or would they all think he’d put himself  in for the tournament?
But how could <PER>Voldemort</PER> have ensured that <PER>Harry</PER>’s  name got into the Goblet of Fire?
Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had  awoken with his scar hurting, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not  been alone ... he had been talking to Wormtail ...  plotting <PER>Harry</PER>’s murder.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady  soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to  let <PER>Harry</PER> into the common room.
“No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed — ”   He wanted more than anything to find <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them  seemed to be in the common room.
<PER>Ron</PER> lay on the bed without  moving, watching <PER>Harry</PER> struggle to remove it.
”   “What d’you mean, congratulations?” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  staring at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS   When <PER>Harry</PER> woke up on Sunday morning, it took him  a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and  worried.
He sat up and ripped back the curtains of  his own four-poster, intending to talk to <PER>Ron</PER>, to force  <PER>Ron</PER> to believe him — only to find that <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed was  empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.
It was a chilly morning, and they kept  moving, munching their toast, as <PER>Harry</PER> told  <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what had happened after he had left  the Gryffindor table the night before.
I don’t think any student could have done it  ... they’d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s — ”   “Have you seen <PER>Ron</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted.
“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, isn’t it obvious?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said  despairingly.
“He’s going to find out anyway — ”   “How?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, very seriously.
“He told me not to use Hedwig  again.”   “Ask <PER>Ron</PER> if you can borrow — ”   “I’m not asking <PER>Ron</PER> for anything,” <PER>Harry</PER> said flatly.
They went up to the Owlery <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a  piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then  strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at  all the different owls, while <PER>Harry</PER> sat down against a  wall and wrote his letter.
He had an urge to  say something about the large weight of anxiety that  seemed to have settled inside his chest since last  night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into  words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink  bottle and wrote,   Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — <PER>Harry</PER>     “Finished,” he told <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to his feet and  brushing straw off his robes.
“First <PER>Ron</PER>, then you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-  Fletchley, with whom <PER>Harry</PER> normally got on very well,  did not talk to him even though they were repotting  Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did  laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing  Bulbs wriggled free from <PER>Harry</PER>’s grip and smacked  him hard in the face.
<PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t talking to <PER>Harry</PER>  either.
Predictably, <PER>Malfoy</PER> arrived at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin with his  familiar sneer firmly in place.
Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”   Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but  <PER>Malfoy</PER> had to stop there, because <PER>Hagrid</PER> emerged  from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower  of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended  Skrewt.
Around the sting, the  blasting end, or the sucker?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Roun’ the middle,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, demonstrating.
...”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s real intention, however, was to talk to <PER>Harry</PER>  away from the rest of the class.
He waited until  everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then  turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and said, very seriously, “So — yer  competin’, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No idea who put yeh in fer it, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt  at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s words.
“Yeh say it wasn’ you,  an’ I believe yeh — an’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes yer, an’  all.”   “Wish I knew who did do it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said  happily.
“Ah, I don’ know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> sighed suddenly,  looking back down at him with a worried expression  on his face.
Yes, everything did seem to  happen to him ... that was more or less what  <PER>Hermione</PER> had said as they had walked around the  lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that  <PER>Ron</PER> was no longer talking to him.
He thought he could have  coped with the rest of the school’s behavior if he could  just have had <PER>Ron</PER> back as a friend, but he wasn’t  going to try and persuade <PER>Ron</PER> to talk to him if <PER>Ron</PER>  didn’t want to.
“It’s really not that difficult, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> tried to  reassure him as they left Flitwick’s class — she had  been making objects zoom across the room to her all  lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet  for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and  lunascopes.
“You just weren’t concentrating properly     “Wonder why that was,” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly as Cedric  Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of  simpering girls, all of whom looked at <PER>Harry</PER> as  though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended  Skrewt.
Being shut  in a dungeon for an hour and a half with <PER>Snape</PER> and  the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to  punish <PER>Harry</PER> as much as possible for daring to  become school champion, was about the most  unpleasant thing <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine.
When he and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived at <PER>Snape</PER> ’s dungeon  after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside,  each and every one of them wearing a large badge on  the front of his or her robes.
badges — then he  saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous  red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit  underground passage:   Support CEDRIC DIGGORY —   The REAL Hogwarts Champion   “Like them, Potter?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly as <PER>Harry</PER>  approached.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Oh very funny,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said sarcastically to Pansy  Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were  laughing harder than anyone, “really witty.”   <PER>Ron</PER> was standing against the wall with Dean and  Seamus.
“Want one, Granger?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, holding out a  badge to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said warningly.
Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in  midair, and ricocheted off at angles — <PER>Harry</PER>’s hit  Goyle in the face, and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hit <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “<PER>Hermione</PER>!”     <PER>Ron</PER> had hurried forward to see what was wrong with  her; <PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw <PER>Ron</PER> dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  hand away from her face.
The Slytherins clamored to give  their explanations; <PER>Snape</PER> pointed a long yellow finger  at <PER>Malfoy</PER> and said, “Explain.”   “Potter attacked me, sir — ”   “We attacked each other at the same time!” <PER>Harry</PER>  shouted.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> got <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
“Loo/d”   He forced <PER>Hermione</PER> to show <PER>Snape</PER> her teeth — she  was doing her best to hide them with her hands,  though this was difficult as they had now grown down  past her collar.
Pansy Parkinson and the other        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles,  pointing at <PER>Hermione</PER> from behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s back.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked coldly at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then said, “I see no  difference.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears,  she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up  the corridor and out of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  started shouting at <PER>Snape</PER> at the same time; lucky  their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for  in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear  exactly what they were calling him.
He passed <PER>Snape</PER>, walked with <PER>Ron</PER> to the  back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto  the table.
<PER>Ron</PER> was shaking with anger too — for a  moment, it felt as though everything was back to  normal between them, but then <PER>Ron</PER> turned and sat  down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving <PER>Harry</PER>  alone at his table.
On the other side of the dungeon,  <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned his back on <PER>Snape</PER> and pressed his  badge, smirking.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat there staring at <PER>Snape</PER> as the lesson began,  picturing horrific things happening to him.
If only  he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse ... he’d have        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Snape</PER> flat on his back like that spider, jerking and  twitching.
...”   <PER>Snape</PER>’s eyes met <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was  coming.
<PER>Harry</PER>  imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to  the front of the class, and bringing it down on <PER>Snape</PER>’s  greasy head —   And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on  <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room,  beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>, and walked up to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk at  the front of the room.
“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take <PER>Harry</PER> Potter  upstairs.”   <PER>Snape</PER> stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose  smile faded from his eager face.
He  chanced half a glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was staring  determinedly at the ceiling.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said Colin, starting to  speak the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had closed the dungeon  door behind him.
In you come,  <PER>Harry</PER>, in you come ... nothing to worry about, it’s just  the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges  will be here in a moment — ”   “Wand weighing?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated nervously.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with <PER>Harry</PER>  before we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing  fixedly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That is — if <PER>Harry</PER> has no  objection?”   “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Now she leaned toward  <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “So, <PER>Harry</PER> ... what made you decide  to enter the Triwizard Tournament?”   “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, but he was distracted by the  quill.
Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing  across the parchment, and in its wake he could make  out a fresh sentence:   An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the  otherwise charming face of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, whose eyes        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Ignore the quill, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Rita Skeeter firmly.
“Now —  why did you decide to enter the tournament, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I didn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ <PER>Dumbledore</PER>l” cried Rita Skeeter, with every  appearance of delight — but <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that her  quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from  the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed       fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her  crocodile-skin bag.
“I was just making the point that some of your ideas  are a little old-fashioned, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and that many  wizards in the street — ”   “I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the  rudeness, Rita,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, with a courteous  bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to  discuss the matter later.
<PER>Harry</PER> had met Mr. Ollivander before —  he was the wand-maker from whom <PER>Harry</PER> had  bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon  Alley.
“One of  my grandmuzzer’s.”   So Fleur was part veela, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, making a  mental note to tell <PER>Ron</PER> .
“Curious,” he  had said, “curious,” and not until <PER>Harry</PER> asked what  was curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the  phoenix feather in <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had come from the  same bird that had supplied the core of Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night,  <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Sirius        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling          THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL   The prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all  that sustained <PER>Harry</PER> over the next fortnight, the only  bright spot on a horizon that had never looked  darker.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be  beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had  suggested, and he and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent a long time  going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the  common room on the night in question.
In the meantime, life became even worse for <PER>Harry</PER>  within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had  published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament,  and it had turned out to be not so much a report on  the tournament as a highly colored life story of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Much of the front page had been given over to a  picture of <PER>Harry</PER>; the article (continuing on pages two,  six, and seven) had been all about <PER>Harry</PER>, the names  of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions  (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of  the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> has at last found love at Hogwarts.
His close  friend, Colin Creevey, says that <PER>Harry</PER> is rarely seen  out of the company of one <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, a  stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, is  one of the top students in the school.
Or is this a school you and  Longbottom have set up together?”   “Hey — <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “Yeah, that’s right!” <PER>Harry</PER> found himself shouting as  he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just  about enough.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had come in for her fair share of  unpleasantness too, but she hadn’t yet started yelling       at innocent bystanders; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> was full of  admiration for the way she was handling the  situation.
“Just ignore it, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   But <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t ignore it.
<PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t spoken to  him at all since he had told him about <PER>Snape</PER>’s  detentions.
<PER>Harry</PER> had half hoped they would make  things up during the two hours they were forced to  pickle rats’ brains in <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, but that had  been the day Rita’s article had appeared, which  seemed to have confirmed <PER>Ron</PER>’s belief that <PER>Harry</PER> was  really enjoying all the attention.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was furious with the pair of them; she went  from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to  each other, but <PER>Harry</PER> was adamant: He would talk to  <PER>Ron</PER> again only if <PER>Ron</PER> admitted that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t put  his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for  calling him a liar.
<PER>Harry</PER> liked <PER>Hermione</PER>  very much, but she just wasn’t the same as <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t mastered Summoning  Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a  block about them, and <PER>Hermione</PER> insisted that  learning the theory would help.
<PER>Hermione</PER> often complained about Krum  being there — not that he ever bothered them — but  because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy  on him from behind bookshelves, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  found the noise distracting.
Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms  correct, it caused him another pang to imagine <PER>Ron</PER>’s  expression if he could have heard <PER>Hermione</PER> talking  about Wonky- Faints.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that it  would do him good to get away from the castle for a  bit, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need much persuasion.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, this is so stupid — ”   “I’ll come, but I’m not meeting <PER>Ron</PER>, and I’m wearing  my Invisibility Cloak.”   “Oh all right then ...” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, “but I hate  talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m  looking at you or not.”   So <PER>Harry</PER> put on his Invisibility Cloak in the  dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he  and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off for Hogsmeade.
“She’s gone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking right through  <PER>Harry</PER> toward the end of the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner  while <PER>Hermione</PER> went to buy drinks.
On his way  through the pub, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted <PER>Ron</PER>, who was sitting  with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw his  and <PER>Ron</PER>’s names at the top of the very short list.
<PER>Hermione</PER> lapsed into thoughtful silence, while <PER>Harry</PER>  drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub.
...   “Look, it’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      The back of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s enormous shaggy head — he  had mercifully abandoned his bunches — emerged  over the crowd.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why he hadn’t  spotted him at once, as <PER>Hagrid</PER> was so large, but  standing up carefully, he saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been  leaning low, talking to Professor Moody.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, he saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Moody get up  to leave.
He tapped <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the small of the back (being  unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to  him, and then the pair of them made their way back  across the pub toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s table.
“All right, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly.
“And it’s come in useful at times, I can  tell you.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> was beaming down at <PER>Harry</PER> too.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew  <PER>Hagrid</PER> couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously  told <PER>Hagrid</PER> he was there.
notebook as well,  and said in a whisper so low that only <PER>Harry</PER> could  hear it, “<PER>Harry</PER>, meet me tonight at midnight at me  cabin.
Wear that cloak.”   Straightening up, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said loudly, “Nice ter see  yeh, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” winked, and departed.
“Why does <PER>Hagrid</PER> want me to meet him at midnight?”  <PER>Harry</PER> said, very surprised.
...” She looked nervously around and hissed,   “It might make you late for Sirius.”   It was true that going down to <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s at midnight  would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine  indeed; <PER>Hermione</PER> suggested sending Hedwig down to  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s to tell him he couldn’t go — always assuming  she would consent to take the note, of course —   <PER>Harry</PER>, however, thought it better just to be quick at  whatever <PER>Hagrid</PER> wanted him for.
He was very curious  to know what this might be; <PER>Hagrid</PER> had never asked  <PER>Harry</PER> to visit him so late at night.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked down the  lawn toward the lights shining in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
The  inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was  also lit up; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear Madame Maxime talking  inside it as he knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s front door.
“You there, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered, opening the  door and looking around.
“What’re you showing me?” <PER>Harry</PER> said warily,  wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or <PER>Hagrid</PER> had  managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a  stranger in a pub.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered  with that cloak,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to  follow and found, to his great surprise, that <PER>Hagrid</PER>  was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what — ?”   “Shhh!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he knocked three times on  the door bearing the crossed golden wands.
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, <PER>Hagrid</PER>  offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge  of the paddock containing Madame Maxime ’s giant  winged horses, with <PER>Harry</PER>, totally bewildered,  running to keep up with them.
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the  same treat as <PER>Harry</PER>, because after a while she said  playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, “worth seem’,  trust me.
Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      ground with a thud that <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn  made the trees behind him quake.
The wizard who had  warned <PER>Hagrid</PER> not to come any closer turned, and  <PER>Harry</PER> realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.
Then he said, “How’s <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Fine,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Before he could stop himself, he was  talking more than he’d talked in days — about how  no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of  his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him  in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a  corridor without being sneered at — and about <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER> not believing him, <PER>Ron</PER>’s jealousy ...       "... and now <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just shown me what’s coming in  the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a  goner,” he finished desperately.
He had let  <PER>Harry</PER> talk himself into silence without interruption,  but now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, <PER>Harry</PER>,  but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long  here ... I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the  fire, but they could be back at any time.
Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily  Prophet, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “ — you and the rest of the world,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that’s  definitely where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was rumored to be last ...  and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament  was coming up, wouldn’t she?”   “Yeah, but ... it’s not very likely she’d have walked  straight into <PER>Voldemort</PER>, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So ... so <PER>Voldemort</PER> could have found out about the  tournament?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?”   “I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know  ... Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go  back to <PER>Voldemort</PER> unless he knew <PER>Voldemort</PER> was  powerful enough to protect him.
There’s someone  coming!”   <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if  someone saw Sirius’s face within the walls of  Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the  Ministry would get dragged in — he, <PER>Harry</PER>, would be  questioned about Sirius’s whereabouts —   <PER>Harry</PER> heard a tiny pop\ in the fire behind him and  knew Sirius had gone.
Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas,  <PER>Ron</PER> stopped dead facing <PER>Harry</PER> across the room, and  looked around.
“What are you doing down here at this time of night?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I just wondered where you — ” <PER>Ron</PER> broke off,  shrugging.
He knew that <PER>Ron</PER> had no idea what  he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on purpose,  but he didn’t care — at this moment he hated  everything about <PER>Ron</PER>, right down to the several  inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama  trousers.
... That’s what you want, isn’t it?”   He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half  expected <PER>Ron</PER> to stop him, he would even have liked  <PER>Ron</PER> to throw a punch at him, but <PER>Ron</PER> just stood  there in his too-small pajamas, and <PER>Harry</PER>, having  stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long  time afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE FIRST TASK   <PER>Harry</PER> got up on Sunday morning and dressed so  inattentively that it was a while before he realized he  was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his  sock.
When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right  parts of his body, he hurried off to find <PER>Hermione</PER>,  locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall,  where she was eating breakfast with <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Feeling  too queasy to eat, <PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Hermione</PER> had  swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged  her out onto the grounds.
...”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, through gritted teeth, “will  you shut up for a bit, please?
I’m trying to  concentrate.”       But all that happened, when <PER>Hermione</PER> fell silent, was  that <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing,  which didn’t seem to allow room for concentration.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons ... the only  champion who didn’t, if <PER>Harry</PER> was right in thinking  that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and  Krum.
...   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” <PER>Harry</PER>  said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric  leaving the Hall.
“Go on, I’ll catch you up.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — ”   “I’ll catch you up, okay?”   By the time <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom of the marble  staircase, Cedric was at the top.
...”   “Never mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly — he knew <PER>Hagrid</PER>  would be in trouble if he told the truth.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have let his worst enemy face  those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps <PER>Malfoy</PER> or  <PER>Snape</PER> ...   “It’s just ... fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric.
Would Moody  go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and tell on <PER>Hagrid</PER>, or just turn  <PER>Harry</PER> into a ferret?
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the  reaction he had expected at all.
And for his Firebolt, he needed —   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, when he had sped into  greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried  apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — I need you to help me.”   “What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, <PER>Harry</PER>?” she  whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the  top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.
I don’t want to suffer.”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked for a moment as though he was going to  laugh; he certainly caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye for the first  time in days, but <PER>Harry</PER> was still feeling too resentful  toward <PER>Ron</PER> to care.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left in a hurry before the noise  attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor  common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, <PER>Harry</PER> stood near the  fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books,  quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of  Gobstones, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s toad, Trevor.
“That’s better, <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s loads better,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  said, looking exhausted but very pleased.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t  manage a spell,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, throwing a rune  dictionary back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, so he could try again,  “threaten me with a dragon.
“Accio Dictionary !”   The heavy book soared out of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand, flew  across the room, and <PER>Harry</PER> caught it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I really think you’ve got it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  delightedly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, we’d better get some sleep ... you’re  going to need it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had been focusing so hard on learning the  Summoning Charm that evening that some of his  blind panic had left him.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
When <PER>Harry</PER> entered, Cedric  gave him a small smile, which <PER>Harry</PER> returned, feeling  the muscles in his face working rather hard, as  though they had forgotten how to do it.
Anything I can  do to help ...”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> so quickly he knew he had sounded  rude, “no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.”   “Nobody would know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Bagman, winking  at him.
...  Horrible pictures formed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind as he heard:  “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” ... “He’s  taking risks, this one!” ... “Clever move — pity it  didn’t work!”   And then, after about fifteen minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> heard  the deafening roar that could mean only one thing:  Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the  golden egg.
“Are you watching this, Mr.  Krum?”   <PER>Harry</PER> soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still  following his progress; its head revolving on its long  neck — if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy —        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      but better not push it too long, or it would be  breathing fire again —   <PER>Harry</PER> plummeted just as the Horntail opened its  mouth, but this time he was less lucky — he missed  the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet  him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the  long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes —   He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and  groans from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be  deep.
...        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, swerving tantalizingly above  her, “come on, come and get me ... up you get now ...”   And then she reared, spreading her great, black,  leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small  airplane — and <PER>Harry</PER> dived.
Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr.  Potter!”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to  subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the  enclosure, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Professor Moody,  and <PER>Hagrid</PER> hurrying to meet him, all of them waving  him toward them, their smiles evident even from this  distance.
...”   “Yeh did it, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely.
An’ agains’ the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie  said that was the wors’ — ”   “Thanks, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, so that <PER>Hagrid</PER>  wouldn’t blunder on and reveal that he had shown  <PER>Harry</PER> the dragons beforehand.
He got to his feet, wanting to see what  was going on outside, but before he’d reached the  mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside  — <PER>Hermione</PER>, followed closely by <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you were brilliant!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said squeakily.
You  really were!”   But <PER>Harry</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was very white  and staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though he were a ghost.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your  name in that goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to  do you in!”   It was as though the last few weeks had never  happened — as though <PER>Harry</PER> were meeting <PER>Ron</PER> for  the first time, right after he’d been made champion.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was about to apologize  and suddenly he found he didn’t need to hear it.
“Forget it.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “I shouldn’t’ve — ”     “ Forget it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned nervously at him, and <PER>Harry</PER> grinned  back.
...”   Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling  more elated than he would have believed possible an  hour ago, <PER>Harry</PER> ducked out of the tent, <PER>Ron</PER> by his  side, talking fast.
Only thing is, it went trampling around in  agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took  marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any  damage to them.”   <PER>Ron</PER> drew breath as he and <PER>Harry</PER> reached the edge of  the enclosure.
“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, and  <PER>Harry</PER>, squinting up the field, saw the first judge —  Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.
“Looking good!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, thumping <PER>Harry</PER> on the  back.
...  What’s he playing at?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t complain!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled excitedly.
You lousy,  biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!”   But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if  Karkaroff had given him zero; <PER>Ron</PER>’s indignation on  his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him.
... Bagman wants a  word, back in the champions’ tent.”   <PER>Ron</PER> said he would wait, so <PER>Harry</PER> reentered the tent,  which somehow looked quite different now: friendly  and welcoming.
“Good one, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “And you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning back.
Well, off you go, then!”   <PER>Harry</PER> left the tent, rejoined <PER>Ron</PER>, and they started to  walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard;  <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hear what the other champions had  done in more detail.
THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went up to the Owlery that  evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could send  Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get  past his dragon unscathed.
On the way, <PER>Harry</PER> filled  <PER>Ron</PER> in on everything Sirius had told him about  Karkaroff.
<PER>Ron</PER> snatched Pigwidgeon out of  the air and held him still while <PER>Harry</PER> attached the  letter to his leg.
I reckon you could win this tournament, <PER>Harry</PER>,  I’m serious.”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Ron</PER> was only saying this to make up  for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he  appreciated it all the same.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however,  leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and  frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
They watched Pigwidgeon  disappear into the darkness, and then <PER>Ron</PER> said,   “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your surprise  party, <PER>Harry</PER> — Fred and George should have nicked  enough food from the kitchens by now.”   Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor  common room it exploded with cheers and yells again.
<PER>Harry</PER> helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten  what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down  with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I was supposed to work out how to get past the  dragon on my own too,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, so only  <PER>Hermione</PER> could hear him, and she grinned rather  guiltily.
Lee passed <PER>Harry</PER> the egg, and <PER>Harry</PER> dug his  fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around  it and prised it open.
... Maybe you’ve got to get past one of  those next, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “It was someone being tortured!” said <PER>Neville</PER>, who  had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over  the floor.
I thought it sounded a bit like Percy  singing ... maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s  in the shower, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Want a jam tart, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said Fred.
“George and I invented them — seven Sickles  each, a bargain!”       It was nearly one in the morning when <PER>Harry</PER> finally  went up to the dormitory with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Seamus,  and Dean.
Really, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as he pulled the hangings on  his four-poster closed, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had a point .
Most of the class — <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin through the back door and barricaded  themselves in; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however,  were among those who remained outside trying to  help <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Don’ frighten him, now!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> shouted as <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Harry</PER> used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at  the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on  them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back.
“Jus’  try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so he won’ hurt  any o’ the others!”   “Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted angrily  as he and <PER>Harry</PER> backed into the wall of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s  cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hagrid</PER> launched himself forward on top of the skrewt  that was cornering <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and flattened it; a  blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the  pumpkin plants nearby.
“Thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said you weren’ allowed inside  the school anymore,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, frowning slightly as  he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started  tugging it over to its fellows.
“I’ve never heard of them before ... where do they  come from?”   <PER>Harry</PER> noticed a dull red flush rising up out of  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s wild black beard, and his heart sank.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Ah, you’re here, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Rita Skeeter as she  looked around.
“Er —  yeah, why not?”   <PER>Harry</PER> had a very bad feeling about this, but there was  no way of communicating it to <PER>Hagrid</PER> without Rita  Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in  silence as <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Rita Skeeter made  arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a  good long interview later that week.
“Well, good-bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to  him as he set off with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Until  Friday night, then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Shell twist everything he says,” <PER>Harry</PER> said under his  breath.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s been in loads of trouble before, and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s never sacked him,” said <PER>Ron</PER>  consolingly.
I  meant best.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed, and, feeling slightly  more cheerful, went off to lunch.
<PER>Harry</PER> thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that  afternoon; they were still doing star charts and  predictions, but now that he and <PER>Ron</PER> were friends  once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again.
<PER>Ron</PER> hovered  behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum,  debating in whispers with <PER>Harry</PER> whether he should  ask for an autograph — but then <PER>Ron</PER> realized that six  or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books,  debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his  enthusiasm for the idea.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Wonder where she’s got to?” <PER>Ron</PER> said as he and  <PER>Harry</PER> went back to Gryffindor Tower.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the  most amazing thing’s happened — please — ”   She seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and started to try to drag him  back along the corridor.
“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick     <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>; he looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>,  intrigued.
“Okay,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, starting off back down the  corridor with <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> hurrying to keep up.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, where are we going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, after  she had led them down through six floors, and  started down the marble staircase into the entrance  hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  excitedly.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> followed  <PER>Hermione</PER> down a flight of stone steps, but instead of  ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the  one that led to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, they found  themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with  torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that  were mainly of food.
He nudged <PER>Ron</PER> and pointed to the painting just  behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, cottoning on.
“And it’s not spew,  <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “Changed the name, have you?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning at  her.
I’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to  make them stop work, I’m not doing it — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      ‘Tm not asking you to!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said impatiently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> seized it, pulled  the door open, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the back,  forcing him inside.
“Dobby has been  hoping and hoping to see <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, and <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter has come to see him, sir!”   Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming  up at <PER>Harry</PER>, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped  eyes brimming with tears of happiness.
One of these, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, was the black one  <PER>Harry</PER> had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr.  <PER>Malfoy</PER> into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave  Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!”   “Winky?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
She and <PER>Ron</PER> had followed  <PER>Harry</PER> and Dobby to the end of the kitchen.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up  behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a  teapot, cups for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, a milk  jug, and a large plate of biscuits.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Good service!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, in an impressed voice.
Hogwarts\ So Dobby and Winky came to  see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sir, and Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took us on!”   Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled  in his eyes again.
... Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he  isn’t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”   “And how much is Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> paying you,  Winky?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked kindly.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said  we is free to — to — ”   Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned <PER>Harry</PER>  closer.
“Dobby likes Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and  our silence for him.”   “But you can say what you like about the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s  now?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked him, grinning.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, thank you,” said Dobby  breathlessly, rubbing his head.
Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to  <PER>Harry</PER>’s great surprise (and <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s too,  by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.
<PER>Hermione</PER> refused, with  a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and  curtsying, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loaded their pockets  with cream cakes and pies.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Thanks a lot!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to the elves, who had all  clustered around the door to say good night.
“You know what?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, once he, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER> had left the kitchens behind and were climbing  the steps into the entrance hall again.
“Wonder what Crouch says at home about  him?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Probably says he’s not a very good Head of  Department,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “and let’s face it ... he’s  got a point, hasn’t he?”   “I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
Will you pay attention?”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s irritated voice cracked like a  whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday,  and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both jumped and looked up.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their  work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into  guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk (<PER>Neville</PER>’s still had  feathers); they had copied down their homework from  the blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in  which Transforming Spells must be adapted when  performing Cross-Species Switches”).
The bell was due  to ring at any moment, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had  been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and  George’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked  up, <PER>Ron</PER> holding a tin parrot and <PER>Harry</PER>, a rubber  haddock.
“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough  to act their age,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with an      angry look at the pair of them as the head of <PER>Harry</PER>’s  haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor — <PER>Ron</PER>’s  parrot’s beak had severed it moments before — “I  have something to say to you all.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  ignored them, which <PER>Harry</PER> thought was distinctly  unfair, as she had just told off him and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see what was funny this time: Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as  though she had never let her hair down in any sense.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> called above the noise, “Potter  — a word, if you please.”   Assuming this had something to do with his headless  rubber haddock, <PER>Harry</PER> proceeded gloomily to the  teacher’s desk.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> waited until the  rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the  champions and their partners — ”   “What partners?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
...   “Why do they have to move in packs?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked  <PER>Ron</PER> as a dozen or so girls walked past them,  sniggering and staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“How’re you  supposed to get one on their own to ask them?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Lasso one?” <PER>Ron</PER> suggested.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to know what was going on inside  <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
The girl walked off looking rather  hurt, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s taunts about her all through History of Magic.
“Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance  with her.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER>’s words about Krum kept coming back to  him.
He wasn’t attracting nearly as much  unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he  suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an  idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave  <PER>Harry</PER> alone, in gratitude for <PER>Harry</PER>’s tip-off about the  dragons.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, of course,  was still quoting Rita Skeeter’s article to him at every  possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and  fewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten <PER>Harry</PER>’s  feeling of well-being, no story about <PER>Hagrid</PER> had  appeared in the Daily Prophet   “She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures,  ter tell yeh the truth,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> asked him how his interview with Rita  Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical  Creatures lesson of the term.
“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, <PER>Harry</PER>,”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> continued in a low voice.
Yeh’d think  she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “ ’Course she did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing lumps of  dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up  his knife to cut some more.
“She can’t keep writing  about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring.”   “She wants a new angle, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> wisely as  he shelled salamander eggs.
“You were supposed to  say <PER>Harry</PER>’s a mad delinquent!”   “But he’s not!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking genuinely  shocked.
“She should’ve interviewed <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grimly.
’ ”   “Said that, did he?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed.
“Well, yeh might’ve bent a few  rules, <PER>Harry</PER>, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?”   “Cheers, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day,  <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Rumors about the Yule Ball were  flying everywhere, though <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t believe half of  them — for instance, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had bought  eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam  Rosmerta.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick,  gave up trying to teach them much when their minds  were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play  games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of  it talking to <PER>Harry</PER> about the perfect Summoning  Charm <PER>Harry</PER> had used during the first task of the  Triwizard Tournament.
Professors  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Moody kept them working until the  very last second of their classes too, and <PER>Snape</PER>, of  course, would no sooner let them play games in class  than adopt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s Christmas, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> lazily; he was  rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time  in an armchair near the fire.
“I’d have  thought you’d be doing something constructive,   <PER>Harry</PER>, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!”   “Like what?” <PER>Harry</PER> said as he watched Joey Jenkins  of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle  Bats Chaser.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ve got till February the twenty-  fourth,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone  else knows what the next task is and you don’t!”   “Leave him alone, <PER>Hermione</PER>, he’s earned a bit of a  break,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he placed the last two cards on  top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing  his eyebrows.
They sat down at the table  with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> felt how much  damage had been done.
“There you go,” said Fred to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, “piece of  cake.”   He got to his feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use  a school owl then, George, come on.
<PER>Ron</PER> stopped feeling his eyebrows and  looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle  at <PER>Harry</PER>.
He and  <PER>Ron</PER> were getting very nervous now, though as <PER>Harry</PER>  pointed out, <PER>Ron</PER> would look much less stupid than  he would without a partner; <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to  be starting the dancing with the other champions.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “<PER>Harry</PER> — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested  they were planning the storming of an impregnable  fortress.
“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and he dashed off upstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho  said, “Well — ”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Entering the common room, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around,  and to his surprise he saw <PER>Ron</PER> sitting ashen-faced in  a distant corner.
“What’s up, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, joining them.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>, a sort of blind horror in his  face.
“I asked her to go with me just now,” <PER>Harry</PER> said dully,  “and she told me.”   <PER>Ginny</PER> had suddenly stopped smiling.
<PER>Hermione</PER>l”   “ What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, completely distracted by this  startling news.
That shut <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> up.
“Thanks a bunch, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sourly.
“All the good-looking ones taken, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> loftily.
Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone  somewhere who’ll have you.”   But <PER>Ron</PER> was staring at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though suddenly  seeing her in a whole new light.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>’s right — you are a girl.
“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners,  we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any,  everyone else has ...”   “I can’t come with you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now blushing,  “because I’m already going with someone.”   “No, you’re not!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You just said that to get  rid of <PER>Neville</PER>!”   “Oh did I?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and her eyes flashed  dangerously.
“Just because it’s taken you three years  to notice, <PER>Ron</PER>, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted  I’m a girl!”   <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, you can go with <PER>Harry</PER>, and  I’ll just—”   “I can’t,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, and she went scarlet too.
<PER>Ron</PER> goggled at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in relief.
“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with <PER>Ron</PER>?” he  said, lowering his voice so that <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t hear.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE YULE BALL   Despite the very heavy load of homework that the  fourth years had been given for the holidays, <PER>Harry</PER>  was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent  the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as  fully as possible along with everyone else.
“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her  saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her  one evening (<PER>Ron</PER> skulking behind <PER>Harry</PER>, keen not to  be spotted by Fleur).
“She really thinks a  lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER> — who are you going to the ball with?”  said <PER>Ron</PER>.
However, <PER>Hermione</PER> merely frowned and  said, “I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of me.”   “You’re joking, Weasley!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, behind them.
Not the long-molared Mudblood?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both whipped around, but <PER>Hermione</PER>  said loudly, waving to somebody over <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  shoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Malfoy</PER> went pale and jumped backward, looking  wildly around for Moody, but he was still up at the  staff table, finishing his stew.
“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> scathingly, and she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went  up the marble staircase laughing heartily.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking sideways at her,  suddenly frowning, “your teeth ...”   “What about them?” she said.
... They’re all ... straight and  — and normal-sized.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly smiled very mischievously, and  <PER>Harry</PER> noticed it too: It was a very different smile from  the one he remembered.
“Here — take it,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> added in an undertone as the third-year  girls scuttled away looking scandalized.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat apart  from everyone else by a dark window that was  gradually filling up with snow, and <PER>Harry</PER> read out:   Dear <PER>Harry</PER>,   Congratulations on getting past the Horntail.
...”   “But he’s right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “you have still  got two tasks to do.
...”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, he’s got ages!” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Want a  game of chess, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yeah, okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Dobbyl” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, scrambling away from the elf  so fast he almost fell out of bed.
<PER>Harry</PER>  Potter did say Dobby could come and see him  sometimes, sir!”   “It’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still breathing rather faster  than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal.
His yell had awoken <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus,   Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER>  decided that now they were awake they might as well  get down to some present-opening too.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned  back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next  to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset  <PER>Harry</PER>.
But sir ...” he said,  his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to  their highest extent, so that they reached to the  bottom of his shorts, “they has made a mistake in the  shop, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, they is giving you two the same!”   “Ah, no, <PER>Harry</PER>, how come you didn’t spot that?” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning over from his own bed, which was now  strewn with wrapping paper.
“Dobby knew  sir must be a great wizard, for he is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s  greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was  also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “They’re only socks,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had gone slightly  pink around the ears, though he looked rather  pleased all the same.
“Wow, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” He had just  opened <PER>Harry</PER>’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s other presents were much more satisfactory  than Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception  of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’, which consisted of a single tissue, an  all-time low — <PER>Harry</PER> supposed they too were  remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had  given <PER>Harry</PER> a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain  and Ireland ; <PER>Ron</PER>, a bulging bag of Dungbombs;   Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock  any lock and undo any knot; and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, a vast box  of sweets including all <PER>Harry</PER>’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s  Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s Best  Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> met up with <PER>Hermione</PER> in the common  room, and they went down to breakfast together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> chose to  watch <PER>Harry</PER> and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather  than join in, and at five o’clock said she was going  back upstairs to get ready for the ball.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER> changed into  their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them  looking very self-conscious, but none as much as  <PER>Ron</PER>, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the  corner with an appalled look on his face.
“Where’s  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Parvati shrugged.
“Shall we go down then, <PER>Harry</PER>?”     “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing he could just stay in the  common room.
Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led  her over to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was in front; he was  wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar,  which in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion made him look like a vicar.
Then Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s voice called,   “Champions over here, please!”   Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and  <PER>Harry</PER> said “See you in a minute” to <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma  and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to  let them through.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      But she didn’t look like <PER>Hermione</PER> at all.
<PER>Ron</PER>,  however, walked right past <PER>Hermione</PER> without looking  at her.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> concentrated on not tripping over his feet.
<PER>Ron</PER> was  watching <PER>Hermione</PER> pass with narrowed eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled happily as the champions  approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an  expression remarkably like <PER>Ron</PER>’s as he watched  Krum and <PER>Hermione</PER> draw nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the hint and  sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new,  navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such  smugness that <PER>Harry</PER> thought it ought to be fined.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced up at <PER>Hermione</PER> to see how she felt  about this new and more complicated method of  dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the  house-elves?
Percy  frowned, but <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had given him a very small wink.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him give a small wave, and looking        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals  glittering in the candlelight.
<PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were  dancing nearby — he could see <PER>Ginny</PER> wincing  frequently as <PER>Neville</PER> trod on her feet — and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was waltzing with Madame Maxime.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “No, I don’t like it,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, and he led her away  from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who  were dancing so exhuberantly that people around  them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to  the table where <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma were sitting.
“How’s it going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, sitting down and  opening a bottle of butterbeer.
“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at him in surprise.
“If you don’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER> scathingly, “I’m not  going to tell you.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at him, then at <PER>Harry</PER>, who  shrugged.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, what — ?”   “He’s from Durmstrang!” spat <PER>Ron</PER>.
You — you’re — ”  <PER>Ron</PER> was obviously casting around for words strong  enough to describe <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s crime, “ fraternizing  with the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!”   <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mouth fell open.
If you really want to know, he — he said  he’d been coming up to the library every day to try  and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up  the courage!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER> said this very quickly, and blushed so  deeply that she was the same color as Parvati’s robes.
... He’s just  trying to get closer to <PER>Harry</PER> — get inside information  on him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though <PER>Ron</PER> had slapped her.
“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single  thing about <PER>Harry</PER>, not one — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> changed tack at the speed of light.
How could you say  something like that — I want <PER>Harry</PER> to win the  tournament, <PER>Harry</PER> knows that, don’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, “I haven’t got a problem  with <PER>Hermione</PER> coming with Krum — ”   But <PER>Ron</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> too.
“No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still glaring after <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, <PER>Ron</PER>?”     Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together  and looking extremely pompous.
The top table was now empty; Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo  Bagman with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>; Madame Maxime  and <PER>Hagrid</PER> were cutting a wide path around the  dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and  Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen.
When the next  song ended, everybody applauded once more, and  <PER>Harry</PER> saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s  hand and make his way back through the crowds, at  which point Fred and George accosted him.
I’ve got a meeting with their Head of  Magical Cooperation in the new year — ”   “Let’s go for a walk,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “get  away from Percy.
...”   Pretending they wanted more drinks, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  left the table, edged around the dance floor, and  slipped out into the entrance hall.
“And  what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> on the path ahead.
“We’re walking,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Snape</PER> shortly.
“Not against  the law, is it?”   “Keep walking, then!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled, and he brushed  past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> continued down the path.
“And since when have he and <PER>Snape</PER> been on first-  name terms?” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER>  speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> froze.
He tapped <PER>Ron</PER> on the shoulder  and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they  could easily sneak off that way without being noticed  (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to <PER>Harry</PER>), but  <PER>Ron</PER>, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur,  shook his head vigorously, and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> deeper  into the shadows behind the reindeer.
<PER>Harry</PER> definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew  <PER>Hagrid</PER> would hate to be overheard in a situation like  this (he certainly would have) — if it had been  possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and  hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option.
<PER>Harry</PER> could have told <PER>Hagrid</PER> it was best not to  answer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his  teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was  no good.
“C’mon,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very quietly to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “What’s up?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at him.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, his expression very  serious indeed.
“About <PER>Hagrid</PER> being  half-giant?”   “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, shrugging.
Brought up by the <PER>Dursley</PER>s,  there were many things that wizards took for granted  that were revelations to <PER>Harry</PER>, but these surprises  had become fewer with each successive year.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  returned to the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down at a  table far removed from the dance floor.
“So?” <PER>Harry</PER> prompted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“There’s nothing wrong with  <PER>Hagrid</PER>!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I know there isn’t, but ... blimey, no wonder he keeps  it quiet,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, shaking his head.
Big bones ... the only  thing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent the rest of the ball discussing  giants in their corner, neither of them having any  inclination to dance.
Out in the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> saw  <PER>Hermione</PER> saying good night to Krum before he went  back to the Durmstrang ship.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed her, but  halfway up the staircase <PER>Harry</PER> heard someone calling  him.
He climbed into the  common room and found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> having a  blazing row.
“What’s that?”   “Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else  does, and not as a last resort!”   <PER>Ron</PER> mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water  as <PER>Hermione</PER> turned on her heel and stormed up the  girls’ staircase to bed.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well —  that just proves — completely missed the point — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t say anything.
He liked being back on  speaking terms with <PER>Ron</PER> too much to speak his mind  right now — but he somehow thought that <PER>Hermione</PER>  had gotten the point much better than <PER>Ron</PER> had.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hair was bushy again; she  confessed to <PER>Harry</PER> that she had used liberal amounts  of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s  way too much bother to do every day,” she said  matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks  behind the ears.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have reached an  unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> wasted no time in telling  <PER>Hermione</PER> about the conversation they had overheard  between Madame Maxime and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER>  didn’t seem to find the news that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was a half-  giant nearly as shocking as <PER>Ron</PER> did.
...   It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked as though he would have liked to reply  scathingly, but perhaps he didn’t want another row,  because he contented himself with shaking his head  disbelievingly while <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t looking.
He,  <PER>Harry</PER>, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in      the first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange  had been to tell <PER>Harry</PER> to take a bath.
Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical  Creatures much in this weather, though as <PER>Ron</PER> said,  the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely,  either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully  that <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin would catch fire.
“I am your temporary Care of Magical  Creatures teacher.”   “Where’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated loudly.
He turned; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the rest of the  Slytherins were joining the class.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> followed her, looking back over their  shoulders at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
“What’s wrong with <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, hurrying to  catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.
The moment Professor Grubbly-  Plank was out of earshot, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
...”   He smirked as <PER>Harry</PER> snatched the page, unfolded it,  and read it, with <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER>  looking over his shoulder.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been  afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes  Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent.
Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who admits to being expelled from  Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of  gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for  him by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
While <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turns a blind  eye, <PER>Hagrid</PER> has maimed several pupils during a series  of lessons that many admit to being “very  frightening.”   “I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent  Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,” says <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a fourth-year student.
“We all hate <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  but we’re just too scared to say anything.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> has no intention of ceasing his campaign of  intimidation, however.
In a bizarre twist, <PER>Hagrid</PER> is reputed to have developed  a close friendship with the boy who brought around  You-Know- Who’s fall from power — thereby driving  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know- Who’s       supporters, into hiding.
Perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is  unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large  friend — but Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surely has a duty to  ensure that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, along with his fellow  students, is warned about the dangers of associating  with part-giants.
<PER>Harry</PER> finished reading and looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>, whose  mouth was hanging open.
“What d’you mean, “we all hate <PER>Hagrid</PER>’?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat  at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
...”   “What about <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said angrily as they went  up the steps.
“I didn’t know half the  things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni — ”   “Look at this!” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled, and he shoved the Daily  Prophet article under <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s nose.
You  don’t think <PER>Hagrid</PER> told her?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, leading the way over to the  Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair,  furious.
“Anyway, she’s not supposed to come into school  anymore, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> banned her.
“Sort of thing she’d do,  isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.”   “Like you and <PER>Ron</PER> did, you mean,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a  nice change, having a proper Care of Magical  Creatures lesson for once — but I do want <PER>Hagrid</PER>  back, of course I do!” <PER>Hermione</PER> added hastily,  quailing under <PER>Harry</PER>’s furious stare.
So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the  castle once more and went down through the frozen        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      grounds to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s us!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, pounding on the  door.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to  <PER>Harry</PER> whenever there was a teacher around, so that  he was safe from <PER>Harry</PER>’s retaliation.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was very surprised that <PER>Harry</PER>  was going to go.
“Really get to  work on that egg.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s  about now,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the castle together on  Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds  toward the gates.
He likes it  much better here, he told me.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Ron</PER> said nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept his eyes skinned for a sign of <PER>Hagrid</PER> all  the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a  visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had  ascertained that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was not in any of the shops.
The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look  around at all the tables told <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Hagrid</PER> wasn’t  there.
Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, ordered three butter-beers from  Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he  might just as well have stayed behind and listened to  the egg wailing after all.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “In a moment, in a moment!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard him say  brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried  through the pub toward <PER>Harry</PER>, his boyish grin back  in place.
“You couldn’t give us a  moment, you two, could you?”   “Er — okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he and <PER>Hermione</PER> went off  to find a table.
“Really superb.”   “Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but he knew this couldn’t be all  that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have  congratulated <PER>Harry</PER> in front of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him glance into the  mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all  watching him and <PER>Harry</PER> in silence through their  dark, slanting eyes.
“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to <PER>Harry</PER> in an  undertone, noticing <PER>Harry</PER> watching the goblins too.
“Well ... well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but —  come on, <PER>Harry</PER> — we all want a Hogwarts victory,  don’t we?”   “Have you offered Cedric help?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
couple more days should crack  it.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      He wasn’t entirely sure why he was refusing  Bagman’s help, except that Bagman was almost a  stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would  feel somehow much more like cheating than asking  advice from <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, or Sirius.
“Can we buy  you a drink?”   “Er ... no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed  glance at <PER>Harry</PER>, “no, thank you, boys ...”   Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as  Bagman, who was surveying <PER>Harry</PER> as though he had  let him down badly.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to rejoin <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What did he want?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had  sat down.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Well, I don’t think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would like it if he  knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still looking deeply disapproving.
“Probably  thinks if Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made head of the  Department of International Magical Cooperation.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> a don’t -joke-about-things-like-  that look, and said, “Funny, goblins looking for Mr.  Crouch.
“Maybe they need an  interpreter.”   “Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?”  <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Haven’t you been listening to  what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin  rebellions?”       “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
She bought drinks, and  she and the photographer made their way through  the crowds to a table nearby, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> glaring at her as she approached.
Why don’t  you come and join — ?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I wouldn’t come near you with a ten-foot  broomstick,” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously.
Rita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she  hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her  crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes  Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview  about the <PER>Hagrid</PER> you know, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Let’s go,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “c’mon, <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> ...”     They left; many people were staring at them as they  went.
“She’ll be after you next, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low  and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the  street.
First <PER>Harry</PER>, then <PER>Hagrid</PER>     “You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> nervously.
“I’m serious, <PER>Hermione</PER>, she’ll dig up  something on you — ”   “My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet She can’t  scare me into hiding!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now striding  along so fast that it was all <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could do to  keep up with her.
The last time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen  <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rage like this, she had hit <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>  around the face.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted, pounding on his front  door.
<PER>Hermione</PER> said, “About t — !” and  then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found  herself face-to-face, not with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but with Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“We — er — we wanted to see <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  in a rather small voice.
She, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> went into the cabin; Fang  launched himself upon <PER>Harry</PER> the moment he entered,  barking madly and trying to lick his ears.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “More tea, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, closing the door  behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, drawing out his  wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared  in midair along with a plate of cakes.
There was a slight pause, and then  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Did you by any chance hear what  Miss Granger was shouting, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> went slightly pink, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled  at her and continued, “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> still  seem to want to know you, judging by the way they  were attempting to break down the door.”   “Of course we still want to know you!” <PER>Harry</PER> said,  staring at <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea  what you said, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, twiddling  his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.
“I just meant —  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, how could you think we’d care what that —  woman — wrote about you?”   Two fat tears leaked out of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s beetle-black eyes  and fell slowly into his tangled beard.
“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still looking carefully up at the  ceiling.
“I have shown you the letters from the  countless parents who remember you from their own  days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I  sacked you, they would have something to say about  it — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Not all of ’em,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely.
“Not all of ’em  wan’ me ter stay.”   “Really, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, if you are holding out for universal  popularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a  very long time,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now peering sternly  over his half-moon spectacles.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, look what I’ve got for relatives!” <PER>Harry</PER> said  furiously.
“Look at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s!”   “An excellent point,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...”   “Come back and teach, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  quietly, “please come back, we really miss you.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> gulped.
Good  afternoon to you all.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left the cabin, pausing only to scratch  Fang’s ears.
<PER>Hermione</PER> kept patting his arm, and at last, <PER>Hagrid</PER>  looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great  man, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ... great man ...”   “Yeah, he is,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Can I have one of these  cakes, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   “Help yerself,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, wiping his eyes on the  back of his hand.
Here ...”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> got up, went over to his dresser, opened a  drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard  with <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat  on top of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s shoulder.
Big bones ... I’ll give her big bones.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another  nervously; <PER>Harry</PER> would rather have taken fifty Blast-  Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to <PER>Hagrid</PER> that  he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime,  but <PER>Hagrid</PER> was still talking, apparently unaware that  he had said anything odd.
School champion!”   He looked at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment and then said, very  seriously, “Yeh know what I’d love, <PER>Harry</PER>?
How you doin’ with that egg,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Great,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Tha’s my boy ... you show ’em, <PER>Harry</PER>, you show ’em.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the castle later that afternoon  with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, unable to banish the image  of the happy expression on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s whiskery face as  he had imagined <PER>Harry</PER> winning the tournament.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling           THE EGG AND THE EYE   As <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how long a bath he would need  to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to  do it at night, when he would be able to take as much  time as he wanted.
The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential,  and as an added precaution, <PER>Harry</PER> thought he would  take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak,  was the most useful aid to rule-breaking <PER>Harry</PER>  owned.
On Thursday night, <PER>Harry</PER> sneaked up to bed, put on  the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had  done on the night when <PER>Hagrid</PER> had shown him the  dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open.
“Good luck,”  <PER>Ron</PER> muttered, climbing into the room as <PER>Harry</PER> crept  out past him.
“You  used to be in there all the time.”   This was true, though only because <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a  convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret —  a forbidden potion that had turned him and <PER>Ron</PER> into  living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so  that they could sneak into the Slytherin common  room.
“Go on!”   <PER>Harry</PER> took a great breath and slid under the surface  — and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the  bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices  singing to him from the open egg in his hands:   “Come seek us where our voices sound,   We cannot sing above the ground,   And while you’re searching ponder this:   We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss,   An hour long you’ll have to look,   And to recover what we took,   But past an hour — the prospect’s black,   Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”   <PER>Harry</PER> let himself float back upward and broke the  bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had had lessons in his youth, but  Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping  that <PER>Harry</PER> would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to  give him any.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again  sometime?” Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as  <PER>Harry</PER> picked up the Invisibility Cloak.
...   And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking  about what he was doing, not concentrating on  anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch,  <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step  <PER>Neville</PER> always forgot to jump.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out his wand and  struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it  blank, but it was too far away to reach —   Pulling the cloak back over himself <PER>Harry</PER>  straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed  up with fear ... and, almost immediately —   “PEEVES!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the  caretaker.
At  the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could  make <PER>Harry</PER>’s situation worse: <PER>Snape</PER>.
“I  seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could  break!” <PER>Snape</PER> looked up the stairs, straight through  <PER>Harry</PER>, and then down into the corridor below.
Go, <PER>Harry</PER>  pleaded with him silently, go with <PER>Snape</PER> ... go ... Mrs.  Norris was peering around Filch ’s legs.
“Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things  around as usual — and then Professor <PER>Snape</PER>  discovered that someone had broken into his off — ”   “Shut up!” <PER>Snape</PER> hissed to Filch.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Moody’s magical eye travel over <PER>Snape</PER>, and  then, unmistakably, onto himself.
Moody could see  through Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the  full strangeness of the scene: <PER>Snape</PER> in his nightshirt,  Filch clutching the egg, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, trapped in the  stairs behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see a  vein flickering horribly on <PER>Snape</PER> ’s greasy temple.
“Not hiding anything else in your office, are  you?”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw the edge of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s sallow face turn a  nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more  rapidly.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me to keep an eye — ”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> happens to trust me,” said <PER>Snape</PER>  through clenched teeth.
“Get back to bed, <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!”  <PER>Snape</PER> hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry  with himself.
As <PER>Snape</PER> and Filch both turned to look at  it, <PER>Harry</PER> threw caution to the winds; he raised his  arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody  to attract his attention, mouthing “It’s mine!
Mine!”   <PER>Snape</PER> had reached out for it, a horrible expression of  dawning comprehension on his face —   “Accio Parchments   The map flew up into the air, slipped through <PER>Snape</PER> ’s  outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into  Moody’s hand.
“It’s mine —  must’ve dropped it earlier — ”   But <PER>Snape</PER> ’s black eyes were darting from the egg in  Filch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and <PER>Harry</PER>  could tell he was putting two and two together, as  only <PER>Snape</PER> could.
“Potter!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled, and he actually turned his  head and stared right at the place where <PER>Harry</PER> was,  as though he could suddenly see him.
Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!”   <PER>Snape</PER> stretched out his hands like a blind man and  began to move up the stairs; <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn  his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff  <PER>Harry</PER> out — trapped, <PER>Harry</PER> leaned backward, trying  to avoid <PER>Snape</PER>’s fingertips, but any moment now —   “There’s nothing there, <PER>Snape</PER>!” barked Moody, “but  I’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your  mind jumped to <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”   “Meaning what?” <PER>Snape</PER> turned again to look at  Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from  <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest.
<PER>Snape</PER> was looking down at Moody, and <PER>Harry</PER>  couldn’t see the expression on his face.
Still  breathing very fast, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Snape</PER> walking away  down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and  disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Map of Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hoping Moody was  going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg  was really hurting him.
Yes ... yes, of course ...”   Moody took hold of <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and pulled; <PER>Harry</PER>’s  leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto  the one above it.
Moody waved the map  in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, who braced himself —   “Can I borrow this?”   “Oh!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in  thought about <PER>Snape</PER>, and Crouch, and what it all  meant.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      And Moody thought he, <PER>Harry</PER>, ought to be an Auror!
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling         THE SECOND TASK   “You said you’d already worked out that egg clue!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> indignantly.
“I just  need to — sort of fine-tune it, all right?”   He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting at the very back  of the Charms class with a table to themselves.
“<PER>Snape</PER> said Moody’s searched his office as well?” <PER>Ron</PER>  whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he  Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it  soared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off).
“What ... d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on  <PER>Snape</PER> as well as Karkaroff?”   “Well, I dunno if that’s what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked him  to do, but he’s definitely doing it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, waving  his wand without paying much attention, so that his  cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.
“Moody said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> only lets <PER>Snape</PER> stay here  because he’s giving him a second chance or  something.
maybe Moody thinks <PER>Snape</PER> put your name  in the Goblet of Fire!”   “Oh <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking her head  sceptically, “we thought <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to kill  <PER>Harry</PER> before, and it turned out he was saving <PER>Harry</PER>’s  life, remember?”   She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room  and landed in the box they were all supposed to be  aiming at.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, thinking ... it  was true that <PER>Snape</PER> had saved his life once, but the       odd thing was, <PER>Snape</PER> definitely loathed him, just as  he’d loathed <PER>Harry</PER>’s father when they had been at  school together.
<PER>Snape</PER> loved taking points from  <PER>Harry</PER>, and had certainly never missed an opportunity  to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he  should be suspended from the school.
He was right to trust  <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Professor Lupin, even though loads of  people wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why  shouldn’t he be right about <PER>Snape</PER>, even if <PER>Snape</PER> is a  bit — ”     “ — evil,” said <PER>Ron</PER> promptly.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his  office, then?”   “Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You just want to think <PER>Snape</PER>’s up to something,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sending her cushion zooming neatly  into the box.
“I just want to know what <PER>Snape</PER> did with his first  chance, if he’s on his second one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grimly,  and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew  straight across the room and landed neatly on top of  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything  odd at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> sent him a letter by brown  owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch  breaking into <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, and Moody and <PER>Snape</PER>’s  conversation.
<PER>Ron</PER> quite liked the idea of using the Summoning  Charm again — <PER>Harry</PER> had explained about Aqua-  Lungs, and <PER>Ron</PER> couldn’t see why <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t  Summon one from the nearest Muggle town.
<PER>Hermione</PER> squashed this plan by pointing out that, in  the unlikely event that <PER>Harry</PER> managed to learn how  to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an  hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the  International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too  much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-  Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.
However, though he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> searched through their lunchtimes,  evenings, and whole weekends — though <PER>Harry</PER> asked  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> for a note of permission to use  the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable,  vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they  found nothing whatsoever that would enable <PER>Harry</PER> to  spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Weekend after next,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had  read the note over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures.”   Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trying to make up for the Blast-  Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two  skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he  could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank  could, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been  continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d  returned to work.
...   “You okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> muttered, moving aside  slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the  baby unicorns.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping a massive hand on his  shoulder, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees buckled under its  weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on  tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh  set yer mind ter.
He looked after everything else on the grounds, after  all —   “Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> growled, patting <PER>Harry</PER>’s  shoulder again, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually felt himself  sink a couple of inches into the soft ground.
Yeh’re goin’ ter win, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy,  confident smile off <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face.
He sat with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the library as the  sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after  page of spells, hidden from one another by the  massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of  them.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart gave a huge leap every time he  saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than  not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a  pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ...”   “I don’t reckon it can be done,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice flatly  from the other side of the table.
...”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I was joking,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily.
“Be a  talking point, wouldn’t it?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> wants  you, <PER>Ron</PER>.
And you, <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   “Why?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking surprised.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt his  stomach drop.
Was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> about to tell  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> off?
“Well meet you back in the common room,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  told <PER>Harry</PER> as she got up to go with <PER>Ron</PER> — both of  them looked very anxious.
He had  searched all the remaining books, and <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had not come back.
He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “I knew it  ... ’e is too young, ’e is only a little boy.” He saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>  flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the  crowd, saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s crestfallen, disbelieving face.
...   Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, <PER>Harry</PER>  stood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily  as he landed on the floor, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a disgusted  look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the  air, but <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurrying up the spiral  staircase to his dormitory.
...        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Lumos,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered fifteen minutes later as he  opened the library door.
“That hurts — get off — ouch — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter must wake up, sir!”   “Stop poking me — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Dobby must poke <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, he must wake  up!”   <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes.
“The  second task starts in ten minutes, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter     “Ten minutes?” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
“Hurry, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s sleeve.
“Dobby knew <PER>Harry</PER> had not found the right book, so  Dobby did it for him!”   “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter has to go into the  lake and find his Wheezy — ”   “Find my what?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “ — and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!”     “What’s a Wheezy?”   “Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy — Wheezy who is  giving Dobby his sweater!”   Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he  was now wearing over his shorts.
“They’ve got ... they’ve got  <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “The thing <PER>Harry</PER> Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked  Dobby.
“It will make <PER>Harry</PER> Potter breathe underwater, sir!”   “Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> frantically, “listen — are you sure  about this?”   He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had  tried to “help” him, he had ended up with no bones in  his right arm.
Dobby cannot let <PER>Harry</PER> Potter lose his  Wheezy!”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s doubts vanished.
“Dobby will  be missed — good luck, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, good luck!”   “See you later, Dobby!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and he  sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three  at a time.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      ‘Tm ... here ...” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, skidding to a halt in  the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.
“Let him catch  his breath!”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, but Karkaroff and  Madame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see him.
“All right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Bagman whispered as he moved  <PER>Harry</PER> a few feet farther away from Krum.
<PER>Harry</PER> twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a  small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed,  its long fingers clutched tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg, its  pointed fangs bared — <PER>Harry</PER> stuck his webbed hand  quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled his ankle  out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he  could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water  over his shoulder at random; every now and then he  felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again,  and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot  connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw  the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while  its fellows shook their fists at <PER>Harry</PER> and sank back  into the weed.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> slowed down a little, slipped his wand back  inside his robes, and looked around, listening again.
<PER>Ron</PER> was tied between <PER>Hermione</PER> and Cho Chang.
leave the  others ...”   “She’s my friend too!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, gesturing toward  <PER>Hermione</PER>, an enormous silver bubble emerging  soundlessly from his lips.
Would he have time to take <PER>Ron</PER> to the surface and  come back down for <PER>Hermione</PER> and the others?
The shark-man swam straight to <PER>Hermione</PER> and began  snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that  Krum’s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for  biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and <PER>Harry</PER>  was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was  going to rip <PER>Hermione</PER> in half.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s legs were seizing up  with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were  aching horribly with the effort of dragging <PER>Ron</PER> and  the girl.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as  though his muscles were screaming in protest; his  very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn’t breathe, he  needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not  stop —   And then he felt his head break the surface of the  lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet  face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he  had never breathed properly before, and, panting,  pulled <PER>Ron</PER> and the little girl up with him.
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of  noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be  on their feet; <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression they thought       that <PER>Ron</PER> and the little girl might be dead, but they  were wrong ... both of them had opened their eyes;  the girl looked scared and confused, but <PER>Ron</PER> merely  expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright  light, turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?”  Then he spotted Fleur’s sister.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you prat,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you didn’t take that song  thing seriously, did you?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have  let any of us drown!”   “The song said — ”   “It was only to make sure you got back inside the time  limit!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over  <PER>Hermione</PER>, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were  wrapped in thick blankets.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Ludo  Bagman stood beaming at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> from the       bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked  very white and somehow much younger than usual,  came splashing out to meet them.
Percy seized <PER>Ron</PER> and was dragging him back to the  bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and  Bagman were pulling <PER>Harry</PER> upright; Fleur had broken  free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.
She seized  <PER>Harry</PER> and pulled him over to <PER>Hermione</PER> and the  others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he  felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a  measure of very hot potion down his throat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, well done!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
He was the only judge who had not left the table;  the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and  relief that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Fleur’s sister had got back  safely.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that  Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself;  perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her  from the lake, but <PER>Hermione</PER> brushed away the beetle  impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time  limit, though, <PER>Harry</PER>.
Madam Pomfrey had  gone to rescue <PER>Ron</PER> from Percy’s clutches; she led him  over to <PER>Harry</PER> and the others, gave him a blanket and  some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and  her sister.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she  turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Fleur bent down, kissed <PER>Harry</PER> twice on each cheek  (he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been  surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again),  then said to <PER>Ron</PER>, “And you too — you ’elped — ”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a  bit — ”     Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head  Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though  he returned one minute outside the time limit of an  hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the  crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look.
However, the Merchieftainess  informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the  hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to  his determination to return all hostages to safety, not  merely his own.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both gave <PER>Harry</PER> half-exasperated,  half-commiserating looks.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, caught by  surprise, stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, then laughed and started  applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “There you go, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted over the noise.
He attempted to engage <PER>Hermione</PER>  in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering  <PER>Harry</PER> to listen.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        PADFOOT RETURNS   One of the best things about the aftermath of the  second task was that everybody was very keen to hear  details of what had happened down in the lake, which  meant that <PER>Ron</PER> was getting to share <PER>Harry</PER>’s limelight  for once.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Ron</PER>’s version of events  changed subtly with every retelling.
At first, he gave  what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s story, anyway — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had put all  the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office, first assuring them that they  would be quite safe, and would awake when they were  back above the water.
“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured  Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on <PER>Ron</PER>  now that he was getting so much attention and was  making a point of talking to him every time they        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     passed in the corridors.
The brown owl that <PER>Harry</PER> had sent to Sirius  with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up  at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers  sticking up the wrong way; <PER>Harry</PER> had no sooner torn  off Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it  was going to be sent outside again.
“I can’t believe him,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tensely, “if he’s  caught ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s  broad back as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> approached.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> headed for a table at the  back of the dungeon as usual.
Once <PER>Snape</PER> had  turned his back on them to write up the ingredients  of today’s potion on the blackboard, <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily  rifled through the magazine under the desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned in closer.
A color  photograph of <PER>Harry</PER> headed a short piece entitled:      <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s Secret Heartache     A boy like no other, perhaps — yet a boy suffering all  the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter.
Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents,  fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thought he had found  solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-  born <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
“I told you!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed at <PER>Hermione</PER> as she stared  down at the article.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave  them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, <PER>Harry</PER>,  and <PER>Ron</PER> started unpacking the ingredients they  would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.
“No, it’s just ... how did  she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the  summer?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> blushed scarlet as she said this and  determinedly avoided <PER>Ron</PER>’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, dropping his pestle with a loud  clunk.
Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets  and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges  so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing  anything over the summer, would I like to — ”   “And what did you say?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had picked up  his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six  inches from his bowl, because he was looking at  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about  anyone else,” <PER>Hermione</PER> went on, going so red now  that <PER>Harry</PER> could almost feel the heat coming from  her, “but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him?
The whole class was now looking around at  them; <PER>Malfoy</PER> took the opportunity to flash POTTER  STINKS across the dungeon at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next  time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’  How very touching,” sneered <PER>Snape</PER>, rolling up the  magazine to continued gales of laughter from the  Slytherins.
<PER>Snape</PER> followed, sat down  at his desk and watched <PER>Harry</PER> unload his cauldron.
Determined not to look at <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> resumed the  mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to  have <PER>Snape</PER>’s face.
“You might be laboring under the delusion that the  entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” <PER>Snape</PER>  went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him  (<PER>Harry</PER> continued to pound his scarab beetles, even  though he had already reduced them to a very fine  powder), “but I don’t care how many times your  picture appears in the papers.
“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> continued  in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized  celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my  office one more time — ”   “I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said <PER>Harry</PER>  angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.
“Don’t lie to me,” <PER>Snape</PER> hissed, his fathomless black  eyes boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
Both come from my private stores, and I know who  stole them.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> stared back at <PER>Snape</PER>, determined not to blink  or to look guilty.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had taken the  boomslang skin back in their second year — they had  needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while <PER>Snape</PER>  had suspected <PER>Harry</PER> at the time, he had never been  able to prove it.
For one wild moment, <PER>Harry</PER>  thought <PER>Snape</PER> was about to pull out his wand and  curse him — then he saw that <PER>Snape</PER> had drawn out a  small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” <PER>Snape</PER>  muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.
“This,” said Karkaroff, and <PER>Harry</PER>, peering around the  edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-  hand sleeve of his robe and show <PER>Snape</PER> something on  his inner forearm.
What are you doing?”   “Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  innocently, straightening up and showing <PER>Snape</PER> the  sodden rag he was holding.
Not  wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry  <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> threw his books and ingredients back  into his bag and left at top speed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> what he had just witnessed.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed over the stile and followed.
It was easy for him, with his four paws, but  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were soon out of breath.
Can’t steal too much food from  Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.”   He grinned up at <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> returned the grin  only reluctantly.
<PER>Ron</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and passed him the Daily  Prophets.
“I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now  — bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to  look after him.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “<PER>Hermione</PER>’s obsessed with house-elfs,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered  to Sirius, casting <PER>Hermione</PER> a dark look.
“Crouch sacked his house-elf?”   “Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and  he launched into the story of the Dark Mark’s  appearance, and Winky being found with <PER>Harry</PER>’s  wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch’s fury.
She was saving Crouch a seat, right?”   “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
Then he  said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, did you check your pockets for your  wand after you’d left the Top Box?”   “Erm ...” <PER>Harry</PER> thought hard.
“Some Bulgarian  ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s ...”   “The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s!” said <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly, so loudly that his  voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak  tossed his head nervously.
“Remember?” she  said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he?” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Told you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking meaningfully at Sirius,  “told you she’s obsessed with house — ”   But Sirius held up a hand to silence <PER>Ron</PER>.
“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf  had been discovered holding <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, what did  Crouch do?”   “Went to look in the bushes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but there  wasn’t anyone else there.”   “Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of  course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf  .
and then he sacked her?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a heated voice, “he sacked  her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let  herself get trampled — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
He suddenly looked as  menacing as he had the night when <PER>Harry</PER> first met  him, the night when <PER>Harry</PER> still believed Sirius to be a  murderer.
“He was  the one who gave the order for me to be sent to  Azkaban — without a trial.”   “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“Crouch used to be Head of the Department  of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook their heads.
Oh never a <PER>Voldemort</PER>       supporter,” he said, reading the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
Apparently they were trying to  find <PER>Voldemort</PER> and return him to power.”   “Crouch’s son was caught?” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If you ask me, he still  thinks he can bring back the old popularity by  catching one more Death Eater.”   “And he sneaked up here to search <PER>Snape</PER>’s office!”  said <PER>Ron</PER> triumphantly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It  would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to  Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.”   “So you think <PER>Snape</PER> could be up to something, then?”  asked <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> broke in.
“Look, I don’t care what you say, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts  <PER>Snape</PER> — ”   “Oh give it a rest, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“I  know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s brilliant and everything, but that  doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool  him — ”     “Why did <PER>Snape</PER> save <PER>Harry</PER>’s life in the first year,  then?
Why didn’t he just let him die?”   “I dunno — maybe he thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would  kick him out — ”   “What d’you think, Sirius?” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, and  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped bickering to listen.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking  thoughtfully at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Ever since I  found out <PER>Snape</PER> was teaching here, I’ve wondered  why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hired him.
Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,” Sirius  added, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at each other.
And <PER>Snape</PER> ’s certainly clever and  cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.”   “<PER>Snape</PER> knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to  keep that quiet,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, you should’ve seen <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when  Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said <PER>Harry</PER>  quickly.
“Karkaroff wanted to talk to <PER>Snape</PER>, he says  <PER>Snape</PER>’s been avoiding him.
He showed <PER>Snape</PER> something on his arm, but  I couldn’t see what it was.”   “He showed <PER>Snape</PER> something on his arm?” said  Sirius, looking frankly bewildered.
“There’s still the fact that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Snape</PER>,  and I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts where a lot of other  people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see him letting <PER>Snape</PER>  teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   “Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office then?” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> made their way back into  Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I don’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Imagine having to live  off rats.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE MADNESS OF MR. CROUCH   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went up to the Owlery  after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy,  asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen  Mr. Crouch lately.
Winky still thinks  Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby  says will persuade her that Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is  her master now.”   “Hey, Winky,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, struck by a sudden  inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down,  “you don’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do  you?
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is brave and noble and  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is not nosy!”   “He is nosing — hie — into my master’s — hie —  private and secret — hie — Winky is a good house-elf  — hie — Winky keeps her silence — hie — people  trying to — hie — pry and poke — hie — ”   Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without  warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring  loudly.
“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at <PER>Harry</PER>’s  elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and  some fruit into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms.
“Good-bye!”   The house-elves crowded around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> and began shunting them out of the  kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of  their backs.
“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you,  <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily as the kitchen door  slammed shut behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> got so  tired of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sniping at each other over  their homework in the common room that he took  Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his  own.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER>  saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> digging energetically in front of his cabin.
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> snarling at each other, <PER>Harry</PER>  watched <PER>Hagrid</PER> digging until the darkness swallowed  him and the owls around <PER>Harry</PER> began to awake,  swooshing past him into the night.
By breakfast the next day <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bad  moods had burnt out, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s relief, <PER>Ron</PER>’s  dark predictions that the house-elves would send       substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because  <PER>Hermione</PER> had insulted them proved false; the bacon,  eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.
“Hey, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I think you’re in luck — ”   A gray owl was soaring down toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s goblet before it was  knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were  jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter  first.
“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  as the owls around <PER>Hermione</PER> took flight.
...”   “I warned her!” said <PER>Ron</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried out of  the Great Hall, cradling her hands.
Look at this one ...” He read  out one of the letters <PER>Hermione</PER> had left behind: “ ‘I  read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter false and that boy has had enough  hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’  Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t turn up for Herbology.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical  Creatures class, they saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle  descending the stone steps of the castle.
Where’s  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “She had to go to the hospital wing,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  grinning.
Oh there  y’are, <PER>Hermione</PER>!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER> was walking toward them across the lawn.
It  turned out that <PER>Ron</PER>’s niffler had been most  successful, so <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave him an enormous slab of  Honeydukes chocolate for a prize.
The bell rang  across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set  off back to the castle, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  stayed behind to help <PER>Hagrid</PER> put the nifflers back in  their boxes.
“What yeh done ter your hands, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking concerned.
Chuck ’em straigh’ in  the fire.”     “You missed a really good lesson,” <PER>Harry</PER> told  <PER>Hermione</PER> as they headed back toward the castle.
“They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, <PER>Ron</PER>?”   <PER>Ron</PER>, however, was frowning at the chocolate <PER>Hagrid</PER>  had given him.
Why didn’t you tell me  it disappeared?”   <PER>Harry</PER> had to think for a moment before he realized  what <PER>Ron</PER> was talking about.
“To have so much money you  don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said  <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently.
Then he said, “I hate being poor.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
Then, when <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look  gloomy, she said, “Come on, <PER>Ron</PER>, it could be worse.
“I’ll get her  back for this if it’s the last thing I do!”     Hate mail continued to arrive for <PER>Hermione</PER> over the  following week, and although she followed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-  wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the  Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the  whole Hall to hear.
Even those people who didn’t read  Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed <PER>Harry</PER>-      Krum-<PER>Hermione</PER> triangle now.
<PER>Harry</PER> was getting sick  of telling people that <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t his girlfriend.
“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!”  <PER>Hermione</PER> panted five minutes later, catching up with  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the entrance hall and pulling  <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand away from one of his wiggling ears so  that he could hear her.
“Moody says he didn’t see her  anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or  anywhere near the lake!”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, is there any point in telling you to drop  this?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
And how she found  out about <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mum!”   “Maybe she had you bugged,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> was fascinated, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> interrupted them.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, did not ask <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to  help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for  which they were both grateful, because their workload  was mounting ever higher in the days before the  Easter holidays.
<PER>Harry</PER> frankly marveled at the fact  that <PER>Hermione</PER> could research magical methods of  eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to  do.
Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s  and <PER>Ron</PER>’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of  homemade toffee.
Bagman will  be there to tell the champions about the third task.”   So at half past eight that night, <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs.
“Fleur keeps going on about  underground tunnels; she reckons we’ve got to find  treasure.”   “That wouldn’t be too bad,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking that  he would simply ask <PER>Hagrid</PER> for a niffler to do the job  for him.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “They’re hedges!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, bending to examine the  nearest one.
Should be fun, eh?”   <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew only too well the kind of creatures  that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was likely to provide for an event like this,  thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had  the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to  help him again, but just then, Krum tapped <PER>Harry</PER> on  the shoulder.
“I’ll wait for you, <PER>Harry</PER>, shall I?”   “No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, suppressing  a smile, “I think I can find the castle on my own,  thanks.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum  did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship.
“What ’re we going this way for?” said <PER>Harry</PER> as they  passed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin and the illuminated  Beauxbatons carriage.
It was as though the  eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was an  equal — a real rival —   “You haff never ... you haff not ...”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> very firmly.
He  reminded <PER>Harry</PER> vividly of an old tramp he had seen  once when out shopping with the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
He reached out  and seized a handful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, dragging him        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      closer, though his eyes were staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s  head.
“Must ... tell ... <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ...”   “Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly and clearly.
“Get up, I’ll take you to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   Mr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s?”   “That’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Warn ... <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I’ll get <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if you let go of me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
My wife and son will be  arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight  with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.”   Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and  seemed completely unaware that <PER>Harry</PER> was there,  which surprised <PER>Harry</PER> so much he didn’t notice that  Crouch had released him.
“Just stay with him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, starting to get up,  but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt  change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around  the knees and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back to the ground.
stronger ... <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I’ll get <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!”  said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ll be back with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as <PER>Harry</PER>  sprinted away from the forest and up through the  dark grounds.
He started running as fast as  he could toward the staircase —   “POTTER!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to a halt and looked around.
“What are you doing here, Potter?”   “I need to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  running back up the corridor and skidding to a  standstill in front of <PER>Snape</PER> instead.
“I’ve got to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?”   <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Snape</PER> was thoroughly enjoying  himself, denying <PER>Harry</PER> the thing he wanted when he  was so panicky.
“Look,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s  — he’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn —     The stone wall behind <PER>Snape</PER> slid open.
“Is there a problem?” he  said, looking between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, sidestepping <PER>Snape</PER> before  <PER>Snape</PER> could speak, “Mr.
Crouch is here — he’s down  in the forest, he wants to speak to you!”   <PER>Harry</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to ask questions, but to  his relief, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did nothing of the sort.
“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off  along the corridor behind <PER>Harry</PER>, leaving <PER>Snape</PER>  standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as  ugly.
“What did Mr. Crouch say, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.
and  Bertha Jorkins ... and — and <PER>Voldemort</PER> ... something  about <PER>Voldemort</PER> getting stronger.
“He’s not acting normally,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, hurrying along  beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I left him with Viktor Krum.”   “You did?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply, and he began to  take longer strides still, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was running to  keep up.
“Krum and I were talking, Mr.  Bagman had just finished telling us about the third  task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch  coming out of the forest — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Where are they?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as the  Beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness.
“Over here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving in front of  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, leading the way through the trees.
“They were here,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hurried forward.
“Stay here.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the  direction of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin.
When he saw  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he tried to sit up, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> put a  hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what the — ?”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> said something  about Crouch — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Crouch?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> blankly.
“Karkaroff, please, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> spoke again until they  heard the unmistakable sounds of <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Fang  returning.
“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the  ground and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> beside him.
I smell double-dealing and corruption in  this whole affair, and you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you, with  your talk of closer international wizarding links, of  rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences —  here’s what I think of you!”   Karkaroff spat onto the ground at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s feet.
“Apologize!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> snarled as Karkaroff gasped for  breath, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s massive fist at his throat, his feet  dangling in midair.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, no\” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shouted, his eyes flashing.
“Kindly escort <PER>Harry</PER> back up to the castle, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
...”   “You will take <PER>Harry</PER> back to school, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,”  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated firmly.
Anything you might want to do — any owls you  might want to send — they can wait until morning, do  you understand me?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Er — yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at him.
An’ you!” <PER>Hagrid</PER>  suddenly said angrily to <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked up at him,  taken aback.
“He wasn’t trying to jinx  me, he just wanted to talk about <PER>Hermione</PER> — ”   “I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER> grimly, stomping up the stairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he  looked quite frightening for a moment.
You can’ trust any of ’em!”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> was in such a bad mood, <PER>Harry</PER> was quite glad  to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady.
He  clambered through the portrait hole into the common  room and hurried straight for the corner where <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting, to tell them what had  happened.
“That’s  why he was gone when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got  there.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had crept  out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to  the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius.
“Just go through it again, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
...”   “He was sanest when he was trying to talk about  <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> winced at the sound  of the name.
He just kept saying he had to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from the window and stared up  into the rafters.
“If <PER>Snape</PER> hadn’t held me up,” <PER>Harry</PER> said bitterly, “we  might’ve got there in time.
D’you reckon  he could’ve beaten you and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> there?”   “Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or  something,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, “because it only shows up to the  boundaries, doesn’t — ”   “Shh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly.
Fred and George came  over the threshold, then froze at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw George  half glance at Fred, before smiling at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at one another.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “You don’t think they know something about all this,  do you?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
They’d tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   <PER>Ron</PER>, however, was looking uncomfortable.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept  checking <PER>Ron</PER>’s watch, having finally discarded his  own, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s was moving so slowly he could have  sworn it had stopped working too.
“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, <PER>Ron</PER>\” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He must’ve left the grounds,  then.”       “But under his own steam?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> eagerly,   “or because someone made him?”   “Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a  broom and flown off with him, couldn’t they?” said  <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too  wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.
“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, “you stick close to Potter, all right?
It  fluttered down beside <PER>Harry</PER> at the same moment that  a tawny owl landed in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching a  copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak.
She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then joined <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Harry</PER> in reading what Sirius had to say on the  mysterious events of the night before last.
Stay close to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, do  not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm  yourself for the third task.
“But if you die during a task — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they?”  said <PER>Harry</PER>.
They could’ve made it look like Krum and  I had a duel or something.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t understand it either,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  desperately.
For the next  few days he spent all of his free time either in the  library with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up hexes, or  else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to  practice.
The trouble  was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on  <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s part.
“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” <PER>Ron</PER> suggested on  Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the  middle of their Charms classroom, having just been  Stunned and reawoken by <PER>Harry</PER> for the fifth time in a  row.
“Just try and fall  backward!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well,  <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“Why don’t you take a  turn?”   “Well, I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s got it now, anyway,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily.
“See you at dinner!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and she set off for  Arithmancy, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> headed toward  North Tower, and Divination.
Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve  in his body were on fire, the screaming filled <PER>Harry</PER>’s  ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      was yelling too.
<PER>Harry</PER>\”   <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes.
“See you later,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>, and he picked  up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring  Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression  of great frustration, as though she had just been  denied a real treat.
Sirius  had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again,  and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to follow his advice: He was  going straight to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
He had heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> accusing  Wormtail of making a blunder ... but the owl had  brought good news, the blunder had been repaired,  somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to  be fed to the snake ... he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was going to be fed  to it instead.
...   <PER>Harry</PER> had walked right past the stone gargoyle  guarding the entrance to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office without  noticing.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you  know what that woman is?”   “I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and  an excellent dancer,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
They don’t all turn out harmless — if, indeed,  you can call <PER>Hagrid</PER> harmless, with that monster  fixation he’s got — ”   “I no more suspect Madame Maxime than <PER>Hagrid</PER>,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, just as calmly.
Then, feeling it was pointless to  pretend that he hadn’t overheard what they had been  saying, he added, “I didn’t see Madame Maxime  anywhere, though, and she’d have a job hiding,  wouldn’t she?”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> behind Fudge’s back, his  eyes twinkling.
“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re  about to go for a short walk on the grounds, <PER>Harry</PER>, if  you’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your  class — ”   “I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said  quickly, looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who gave him a swift,  searching look.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> sat down in a chair in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  desk.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office gave an almighty lurch — <PER>Harry</PER>  was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the  substance inside the basin —   But his head did not hit the stone bottom.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a kind of strangled whisper.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed, nonplussed, at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, then  around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...   <PER>Harry</PER> raised his right hand, hesitated, and then  waved it energetically in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not blink, look around at <PER>Harry</PER>, or  indeed move at all.
the <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sitting next to him now  was silver-haired, just like the present-day  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Then  <PER>Harry</PER> heard, quite distinctly, from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, “Filth.”   <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward so that he could see past  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “No,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t.
“Let us hear them, please.”   “You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly,   “that <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> operated always in  the greatest secrecy.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at him  once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk  out of his nose to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed  <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> useful information from  inside the Ministry itself!”   <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck  gold.
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER>!”   “<PER>Snape</PER> has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch  disdainfully.
“He has been vouched for by Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that  bound him to the chair.
Severus <PER>Snape</PER>  is a Death Eater!”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gotten to his feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around;  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting beside him again, wearing  different robes.
“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone  muttered dryly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
The four of you stand accused of  capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and  subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him  to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your  exiled master, <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> — ”   “Father, I didn’t!” shrieked the boy in chains below.
You  planned to restore <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> to  power, and to resume the lives of violence you        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      presumably led while he was strong.
Father,  please!”   “I think, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is time to return to my office,” said  a quiet voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
There was an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sitting on his right,  watching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the  dementors — and there was an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on  his left, looking right at him.
“Come,” said the <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his left, and he put  his hand under <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt himself  rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him;  for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as  though he had done a slow-motion somersault,  suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like  the dazzling light of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s sunlit office.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I  didn’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I quite understand,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> added this fresh thought to the basin,  and <PER>Harry</PER>, astonished, saw his own face swimming      around the surface of the bowl.
and <PER>Harry</PER> saw his own face  change smoothly into <PER>Snape</PER>’s, who opened his mouth  and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
“It’s coming back ... Karkaroff’s too ... stronger and  clearer than ever ...”   “A connection I could have made without assistance,”  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed, “but never mind.” He peered over  the top of his half-moon spectacles at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was  gaping at <PER>Snape</PER>’s face, which was continuing to swirl  around the bowl.
She took no notice whatsoever of <PER>Harry</PER> or Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “But why, Bertha,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sadly, looking up  at the now silently revolving girl, “why did you have to  follow him in the first place?”   “Bertha?” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, looking up at her.
“That was  Bertha as I remember her at school.”   The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face, and it struck <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly how  very old he was looking.
He knew, of course, that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was getting on in years, but somehow he  never really thought of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as an old man.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped pacing and looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”       <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked very intently at <PER>Harry</PER> for a  moment, and then said, “I have a theory, no more  than that.
It is my belief that your scar hurts both  when Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> is near you, and when he is  feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.”   “But ... why?”   “Because you and he are connected by the curse that  failed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> — did you see <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“How indeed     Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> spoke for a while.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said at last, “do you think he’s  getting stronger?”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER> over  the Pensieve.
It was the characteristic, piercing look  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given him on other occasions, and  always made <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were  seeing right through him in a way that even Moody’s      magical eye could not.
“Once again, <PER>Harry</PER>, I can only  give you my suspicions.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed again, and he looked older, and  wearier, than ever.
You see, I read the Muggle newspapers,  unlike most of my Ministry friends.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked very seriously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
that court thing I was  in ... in the Pensieve?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “You could,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heavily.
Well ... were they talking  about <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents?”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a very sharp look.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how  he could have failed to ask <PER>Neville</PER> this, in almost four  years of knowing him.
“Yes, they were talking about <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He and his wife were tortured  for information about <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s whereabouts after  he lost his powers, as you heard.”   “So they’re dead?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“No,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice full of a bitterness  <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard there before.
“Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, staring at the contents of  the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly  now that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had stopped adding thoughts.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> glanced down into it, and then up  at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s light blue eyes, and  the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his  mouth before he could stop it.
“What made you think he’d really stopped supporting  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, Professor?”       <PER>Dumbledore</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze for a few seconds, and  then said, “That, <PER>Harry</PER>, is a matter between Professor  <PER>Snape</PER> and myself.”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the interview was over; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone  that told <PER>Harry</PER> it was time to go.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door.
He stared at  <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with  the third task.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE THIRD TASK   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons You- Know- Who’s getting  stronger again as well?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered.
Everything <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the Pensieve, nearly  everything <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told and shown him  afterward, he had now shared with <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> — and, of course, with Sirius, to whom  <PER>Harry</PER> had sent an owl the moment he had left  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat  up late in the common room once again that night,  talking it all over until <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind was reeling, until  he understood what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had meant about a  head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have  been a relief to siphon them off.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought  he saw <PER>Ron</PER> shiver slightly, even though the evening  was warm.
“And he trusts <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
“He really trusts  <PER>Snape</PER>, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked  Crouch?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, turning back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but he’s only saying that because  Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.”   “We never thought of her, did we?” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, you need to get  some sleep.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went slowly upstairs to their  dormitory.
As <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on his pajamas, he looked  over at <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed.
True to his word to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  he had not told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about <PER>Neville</PER>’s  parents.
He often got sympathy from strangers for being an  orphan, but as he listened to <PER>Neville</PER>’s snores, he  thought that <PER>Neville</PER> deserved it more than he did.
It was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, staring up at the  canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
...   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were supposed to be studying for  their exams, which would finish on the day of the       third task, but they were putting most of their efforts  into helping <PER>Harry</PER> prepare.
“Don’t worry about it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said shortly when  <PER>Harry</PER> pointed this out to them and said he didn’t  mind practicing on his own for a while, “at least we’ll  get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Tired of walking in on <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> all  over the school, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had given them  permission to use the empty Transfiguration  classroom at lunchtimes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had soon mastered  the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and  obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would  enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and  the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  that would make his wand point due north, therefore  enabling him to check whether he was going in the  right direction within the maze.
This was      supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around  himself that deflected minor curses; <PER>Hermione</PER>  managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs  Jinx, and <PER>Harry</PER> wobbled around the room for ten  minutes afterward before she had looked up the  counter-jinx.
“What’s <PER>Malfoy</PER> doing?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> went to see.
Like <PER>Hermione</PER>, he  seemed to want to concentrate on getting <PER>Harry</PER>  through the last task before they concerned  themselves with anything else.
He reminded <PER>Harry</PER> in  every letter that whatever might be going on outside        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      the walls of Hogwarts was not <PER>Harry</PER>’s responsibility,  nor was it within his power to influence it.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together, staring at her.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, trying to shove the  paper out of sight, but <PER>Ron</PER> grabbed it.
“Rita Skeeter again?”       “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and just like <PER>Hermione</PER>, he attempted  to push the paper out of sight.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could demand to see the paper,  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouted across the Great Hall from the  Slytherin table.
“Let me see it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned it over and found himself staring at his  own picture, beneath the banner headline:   HARRY POTTER   “DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”   The boy who defeated <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> is  unstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter,  Special Correspondent.
“This could be a plea for attention.”   The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying  facts about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thatAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from  the wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue, ” reveals <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  a Hogwarts fourth year.
“But I ... but ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at each other.
“S’pose so,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>; but just then,   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came walking alongside the  Gryffindor table toward him.
“She doesn’t expect the <PER>Dursley</PER>s to turn up, does  she?” he asked <PER>Ron</PER> blankly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on, they’re waiting for you!”   Utterly perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> got up.
She had  always refrained from criticizing the <PER>Dursley</PER>s in front  of <PER>Harry</PER>, but her eyes flashed every time they were  mentioned.
It’s all  right,” he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty,  while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, “they’re all called  stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it  wasn’t hard.”   Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> came to sit next to them too,  and <PER>Harry</PER> was having such a good time he felt almost  as though he were back at the Burrow; he had  forgotten to worry about that evening’s task, and not  until <PER>Hermione</PER> turned up, halfway through lunch,  did he remember that she had had a brainwave about  Rita Skeeter.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, Professor Moody,  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Professor Flitwick came  walking into the stadium and approached Bagman  and the champions.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered, and the four of  them walked away in different directions, to station  themselves around the maze.
“And  in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons  Academy!”       <PER>Harry</PER> could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> applauding Fleur politely, halfway up  the stands.
He summoned the happiest thought he could,  concentrated with all his might on the thought of       getting out of the maze and celebrating with <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, raised his wand, and cried, “Expecto  Patronum).”   A silver stag erupted from the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand  and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back  and tripped over the hem of its robes.
“Stupefy'.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded;   <PER>Harry</PER> ducked just in time, but could smell burning  hair; it had singed the top of his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> took  that for a “yes.” <PER>Harry</PER> cast his mind around.
Cedric was  sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and  <PER>Harry</PER> knew he would never catch up, Cedric was  much taller, had much longer legs —        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw something immense over a hedge to  his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected  with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about  to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had  not seen it —   “Cedric!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed.
“Stupefy'.” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled; the spell hit the spider’s  gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did,  he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider  jerked, scuttled around, and ran at <PER>Harry</PER> instead.
He could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy'.” too, but  his spell had no more effect than <PER>Harry</PER>’s — <PER>Harry</PER>  raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once  more and shouted “ Expelliarmus'.”   It worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider  drop him, but that meant that <PER>Harry</PER> fell twelve feet  onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath  him.
“Come here.”   He grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm below the shoulder and  helped <PER>Harry</PER> limp toward the plinth where the cup  stood.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE   <PER>Harry</PER> felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured  leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of  the Triwizard Cup at last.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      And then, without warning, <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar exploded  with pain.
TOM RIDDLE        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords  around <PER>Harry</PER>, tying him from neck to ankles to the  headstone.
Once sure that <PER>Harry</PER> was  bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t  move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black  material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it  roughly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth; then, without a word, he  turned from <PER>Harry</PER> and hurried away.
Then he came back within <PER>Harry</PER>’s  range of vision, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw him pushing a stone  cauldron to the foot of the grave.
It was full of what  seemed to be water — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it slopping  around — and it was larger than any cauldron <PER>Harry</PER>  had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a  full-grown man to sit in.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized what Wormtail was about to do a  second before it happened — he closed his eyes as  tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream  that pierced the night, that went through <PER>Harry</PER> as  though he had been stabbed with the dagger too.
<PER>Harry</PER>  couldn’t stand to look ... but the potion had turned a  burning red; the light of it shone through <PER>Harry</PER>’s  closed eyelids...   Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony.
Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      pocket for a glass vial and held it to <PER>Harry</PER>’s cut, so  that a dribble of blood fell into it.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at  <PER>Harry</PER> .
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE DEATH EATERS   <PER>Voldemort</PER> looked away from <PER>Harry</PER> and began  examining his own body.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>  turned his scarlet eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, laughing a high,  cold, mirthless laugh.
“The other arm, Wormtail.”   “Master, please ... please ...”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left  arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past  his elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw something upon the skin  there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with  a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that  had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup:  the Dark Mark.
The scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead seared with a sharp  pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl;  <PER>Voldemort</PER> removed his fingers from Wormtail’s mark,  and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it had turned jet black.
The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of  them approaching <PER>Voldemort</PER> on his knees and  kissing his robes, before backing away and standing  up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom  Riddle’s grave, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the sobbing and  twitching heap that was Wormtail.
perhaps that champion of  commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   At the mention of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s name, the members  of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook  their heads.
You know that, don’t you?”   “Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master ...  please ...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Yet you helped return me to my body,” said  <PER>Voldemort</PER> coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the  ground.
“Had  there been any sign from you, any whisper of your  whereabouts, I would have been at your side  immediately, nothing could have prevented me — ”   “And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful  Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said  <PER>Voldemort</PER> lazily, and Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped talking  abruptly.
...”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> moved on, and stopped, staring at the  space — large enough for two people — that  separated <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the next man.
...   “Yes,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a grin curling his lipless mouth  as the eyes of the circle flashed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s direction.
“You know, of course, that they have called this boy  my downfall?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said softly, his red eyes  upon <PER>Harry</PER>, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that  he almost screamed in agony.
I could not touch the  boy.”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised one of his long white fingers and put  it very close to <PER>Harry</PER>’s cheek.
The Death Eaters were quite  motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed  upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
And here he is  ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall...”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> moved slowly forward and turned to face  <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wormtail raised his new silver hand,  pulled out the wad of material gagging <PER>Harry</PER>, and  then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying  <PER>Harry</PER> to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when <PER>Harry</PER> might  have considered running for it, but his injured leg  shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave,  as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter  circle around him and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, so that the gaps  where the missing Death Eaters should have stood  were filled.
Wormtail walked out of the circle to the  place where Cedric’s body lay and returned with  <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, which he thrust roughly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s  hand without looking at him.
“You have been taught how to duel, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”  said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, his red eyes glinting through  the darkness.
...   “We bow to each other, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>,  bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face  upturned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I said, bow,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said, raising his wand — and  <PER>Harry</PER> felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible  hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the  Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.
“Very good,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, and as he raised  his wand the pressure bearing down upon <PER>Harry</PER> lifted  too.
...   “And now — we duel.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised his wand, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could do  anything to defend himself, before he could even  move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and scrambled  to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as  Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off;  he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death  Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
... Perhaps another little dose of pain?”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised his wand, but this time <PER>Harry</PER> was  ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch  training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground;  he rolled behind the marble headstone of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed  him.
“We are not playing hide-and-seek, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the  Death Eaters laughed.
And as he heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> draw nearer still, he  knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or  reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a  child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die  kneeling at <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s feet ... he was going to die  upright like his father, and he was going to die trying  to defend himself, even if no defense was possible.
...   Before <PER>Voldemort</PER> could stick his snakelike face  around the headstone, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up ... he gripped  his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of  him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> shouted,   “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Voldemort</PER> cried, “Avada KedavraV’   A jet of green light issued from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand just  as a jet of red light blasted from <PER>Harry</PER>’s — they met  in midair — and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand was vibrating  as though an electric charge were surging through it;  his hand seized up around it; he couldn’t have  released it if he’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of  light connected the two wands, neither red nor green,  but bright, deep gold.
<PER>Harry</PER>, following the beam with  his astonished gaze, saw that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s long white  fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking  and vibrating.
The  Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking  <PER>Voldemort</PER> for instructions; they were closing in,  reforming the circle around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the      snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing  their wands —     The golden thread connecting <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>  splintered; though the wands remained connected, a  thousand more beams arced high over <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, crisscrossing all around them, until they  were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage  of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like  jackals, their cries strangely muffled now.
...   “Do nothing!” <PER>Voldemort</PER> shrieked to the Death  Eaters, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw his red eyes wide with  astonishment at what was happening, saw him  fighting to break the thread of light still connecting  his wand with <PER>Harry</PER>’s; <PER>Harry</PER> held onto his wand  more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread  remained unbroken.
It was coming from every thread of the light-  spun web vibrating around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
and now the beam between       him and <PER>Voldemort</PER> changed too ... it was as though  large beads of light were sliding up and down the  thread connecting the wands — <PER>Harry</PER> felt his wand  give a shudder under his hand as the light beads  began to slide slowly and steadily his way.
The closer that bead  moved, the harder <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand vibrated; he was sure  his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as  though it was about to shatter under his fingers —   He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon  forcing the bead back toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his ears full  of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed ... and slowly,  very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then,  just as slowly, they began to move the other way ...  and it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s wand that was vibrating extra-  hard now ... <PER>Voldemort</PER> who looked astonished, and  almost fearful.
...   At once, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand began to emit echoing  screams of pain ... then — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s red eyes  widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out  of the tip of it and vanished .
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at  <PER>Voldemort</PER> .
the dense  shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms  and torso ... an old man <PER>Harry</PER> had seen only in a  dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the  wand just as Cedric had done ... and his ghost, or his  shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and  surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the golden web,  and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning  on his walking stick.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “He was a real wizard, then?” the old man said, his  eyes on <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Don’t let  him get you, <PER>Harry</PER> — don’t let go!”   She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace  around the inner walls of the golden web, while the  Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s dead victims whispered as they circled  the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to  <PER>Harry</PER>, and hissed words <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear to  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand ... and <PER>Harry</PER> knew when he saw it  who it would be ... he knew, as though he had  expected it from the moment when Cedric had  appeared from the wand .
tall  and untidy-haired like <PER>Harry</PER>, the smoky, shadowy  form of James Potter blossomed from the end of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand, fell to the ground, and  straightened like his wife.
He walked close to <PER>Harry</PER>,  looking down at him, and he spoke in the same  distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so  that <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his face now livid with fear as his  victims prowled around him, could not hear.
you  must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts  ... do you understand, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on  his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his  fingers.
...”   “NOW!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled; he didn’t think he could have  held on for another moment anyway — he pulled his  wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the  golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the  phoenix song died — but the shadowy figures of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s victims did not disappear — they were        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      closing in upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>, shielding <PER>Harry</PER> from his  gaze —   And <PER>Harry</PER> ran as he had never run in his life,  knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he  passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their  curses following him, hearing them hit the  headstones — he was dodging curses and graves,  pelting toward Cedric’s body, no longer aware of the  pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what  he had to do —   “Stun him\” he heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> scream.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand had closed on Cedric’s wrist; one  tombstone stood between him and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but  Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of  reach —        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s red eyes flamed in the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER>  caught it by the handle —   He heard <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s scream of fury at the same  moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that  meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him  away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along  with him.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        VERITASERUM   <PER>Harry</PER> felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face  was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his  nostrils.
He raised his free hand and seized  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wrist, while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face swam in  and out of focus.
Dead).”     “<PER>Harry</PER>, let go of him,” he heard Fudge’s voice say, and  he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric’s limp  body, but <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t let him go.
...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent down, and with extraordinary  strength for a man so old and thin, raised <PER>Harry</PER> from  the ground and set him on his feet.
“I’ll take <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’ll take him — ”   “No, I would prefer — ”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Amos Diggory’s running ... he’s coming  over.
...   “It’s all right, son, I’ve got you ... come on ... hospital  wing ...”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said stay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> thickly, the  pounding in his scar making him feel as though he  was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse  than ever.
“What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?” the man asked at last as he  lifted <PER>Harry</PER> up the stone steps.
“Took me and Cedric to a graveyard ...  and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there ... Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> ...”   Clunk.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back, <PER>Harry</PER>?
the very great  pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the  continued rise of the Dark Order!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “You’re mad,” <PER>Harry</PER> said — he couldn’t stop himself  — “you’re mad!”     “Mad, am I?” said Moody, his voice rising  uncontrollably.
He is back, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, you did not conquer him —  and now — I conquer you!”   Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; <PER>Harry</PER>  plunged his own hand into his robes —   “Stupefy\” There was a blinding flash of red light, and  with a great splintering and crashing, the door of  Moody’s office was blasted apart —   Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still staring at the place where Moody’s face  had been, saw Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,  and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looking back at him out of  the Foe-Glass.
At that moment, <PER>Harry</PER> fully understood for the first  time why people said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only wizard  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had ever feared.
The look upon  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face as he stared down at the  unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more  terrible than <PER>Harry</PER> could have ever imagined.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> went straight to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he ought to — look at him — he’s been  through enough tonight — ”   “He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to  understand,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> curtly.
Then he turned  to Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
Take the dog      up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly,  then come back here.”   If either <PER>Snape</PER> or <PER>McGonagall</PER> found these  instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, astounded,  as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed the third, fourth, fifth, and  sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the  trunk, and each time revealing different contents.
<PER>Harry</PER>, throw down the imposter’s        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      cloak — he’s freezing.
Madam Pomfrey will need to see  him, but he seems in no immediate danger.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did as he was told; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> covered Moody  in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered  out of the trunk again.
“Polyjuice Potion, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Severus, you have the potion?”   <PER>Snape</PER> handed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a small glass bottle of  completely clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which  he had threatened <PER>Harry</PER> in class.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> got up,  bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a  sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe-  Glass, in which the reflections of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>,  and <PER>McGonagall</PER> were still glaring down upon them      all.
...”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> softly.
I  was myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.”   “And what did Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> ask you to do?” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I  told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Snape</PER> had told me where to come.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE PARTING OF THE WAYS   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up.
“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I  take <PER>Harry</PER> upstairs?”   “Of course,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Severus” — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to <PER>Snape</PER> — “please  tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to  get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said gently.
...   “Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> mumbled, “where are Mr. and Mrs.  Diggory?”   “They are with Professor Sprout,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and <PER>Harry</PER>  went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.
“I need to know what happened after you touched the  Portkey in the maze, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Let him  rest.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took no notice of Sirius’s words.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to  say something, his hand still tight on <PER>Harry</PER>’s  shoulder, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised his hand to stop  him, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad of this, because it was easier  to keep going now he had started.
When <PER>Harry</PER> told of Wormtail piercing his arm with  the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement  exclamation and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up so quickly that  <PER>Harry</PER> started.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked around the desk  and told <PER>Harry</PER> to stretch out his arm.
“He said my blood would make him stronger than if  he’d used someone else’s,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And he was right — he could touch  me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”   For a fleeting instant, <PER>Harry</PER> thought he saw a gleam  of something like triumph in <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s eyes.
But  next second, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure he had imagined it, for  when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had returned to his seat behind  the desk, he looked as old and weary as <PER>Harry</PER> had  ever seen him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, continue,  please.”   <PER>Harry</PER> went on; he explained how <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he  could remember of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s speech to the Death  Eaters.
“The wands connected?” he said, looking from <PER>Harry</PER>  to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Why?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again, on whose face  there was an arrested look.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s wand and  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand share cores.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “They will not work properly against each other,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He looked interrogatively at <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
“Which means,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, his eyes  upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, “that some form of Cedric must  have reappeared.”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded again.
am I correct, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “He spoke to me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Sirius’s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder was now so tight it  was painful.
what did they do?”   <PER>Harry</PER> described how the figures that had emerged  from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden  web, how <PER>Voldemort</PER> had seemed to fear them, how  the shadow of <PER>Harry</PER>’s father had told him what to do,  how Cedric’s had made its final request.
He transformed back  into the great black dog and walked with <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of the office, accompanying them  down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pushed open the door, <PER>Harry</PER> saw  Mrs. Weasley, Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> grouped  around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey.
All of them whipped  around as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and the black dog  entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled  scream.
Oh <PER>Harry</PER>!”   She started to hurry toward him, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  moved between them.
If  he would like you all to stay with him,” he added,  looking around at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Bill too, “you  may do so.
She  rounded on <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Bill as though they  were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear?
He  needs quiet!”   “Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the  great black dog that was Sirius, “may I ask what — ?”   “This dog will be remaining with <PER>Harry</PER> for a while,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
<PER>Harry</PER> — I will wait while you  get into bed.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for asking the others not to question  him.
“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with  Fudge, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black  dog came around the screen and settled themselves  in chairs on either side of him.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  were looking at him almost cautiously, as though  scared of him.
“When <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  finds out — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> heard the hospital doors burst open.
Professors  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER> were at his heels.
“What has happened?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply,  looking from Fudge to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“The Minister has seen to  that!”   <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lose  control like this.
He  brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ”   “I told him you would not agree, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> fumed.
“I told him you would  never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle,  but — ”   “My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked  angrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him, “as Minister of  Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring  protection with me when interviewing a possibly  dangerous — ”   But Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s voice drowned Fudge’s.
“The moment that — that thing entered the room,”  she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over,  “it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a chill in his stomach as Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> struggled to find words to describe what  had happened.
From what  Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have  thought he was doing it all on You-Know- Who’s  instructions!”   “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> was giving him instructions,  Cornelius,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said.
Come  now, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ...”   “As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “we heard Barry Crouch confess.
Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how  he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how <PER>Voldemort</PER>  — learning of his continued existence from Bertha  Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used  him to capture <PER>Harry</PER>.
Crouch has helped <PER>Voldemort</PER> to return.”   “See here, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said Fudge, and <PER>Harry</PER> was  astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face,  “you — you can’t seriously believe that.
certainly,  Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon       You-Know- Who’s orders — but to take the word of a  lunatic like that, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ...”   “When <PER>Harry</PER> touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he  was transported straight to <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> steadily.
I will explain it all to you if you will step up to  my office.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> glanced around at <PER>Harry</PER> and saw that he  was awake, but shook his head and said, “I am afraid  I cannot permit you to question <PER>Harry</PER> tonight.”   Fudge’s curious smile lingered.
He too glanced at  <PER>Harry</PER>, then looked back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and said,  “You are — er — prepared to take <PER>Harry</PER>’s word on  this, are you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by  Sirius growling.
“Certainly, I believe <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You are prepared to believe that Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has  returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a  boy who ... well ...”   Fudge shot <PER>Harry</PER> another look, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly  understood.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped.
And  having funny turns all over the place — ”   “I assume that you are referring to the pains <PER>Harry</PER>  has been experiencing in his scar?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  coolly.
Possibly — hallucinations?”   “Listen to me, Cornelius,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, taking a  step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to  radiate that indefinable sense of power that <PER>Harry</PER>  had felt after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had Stunned young  Crouch.
I believe it  hurts him when Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> is close by, or feeling  particularly murderous.”   Fudge had taken half a step back from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  but he looked no less stubborn.
...”   “Look, I saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> come back!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ”   <PER>Snape</PER> made a sudden movement, but as <PER>Harry</PER>  looked at him, <PER>Snape</PER>’s eyes flew back to Fudge.
For heaven’s sake,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — the boy was full of some crackpot  story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting  taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can  talk to snakes, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and you still think he’s  trustworthy?”   “You fool!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> cried.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> has returned,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated.
Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night  because we know the dementors are standing guard  at Azkaban!”   “The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds,  Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of  creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“What madness is this?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is  too late,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “or <PER>Voldemort</PER> will  persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among  wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!”   “You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped,  shaking his head and retreating further from  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“If the magical community got wind that  I had approached the giants — people hate them,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — end of my career — ”   “You are blinded,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice rising  now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes  blazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold,  Cornelius!
Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were staring at Fudge.
And I — I shall act as I see fit.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice carried no hint of a threat; it  sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as  though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were advancing upon him with a  wand.
But if  you’re going to work against me — ”   “The only one against whom I intend to work,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “is Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “He  can’t be back, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he just can’t be ...”   <PER>Snape</PER> strode forward, past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pulling up  the left sleeve of his robes as he went.
He stared, apparently repelled by the  ugly mark on <PER>Snape</PER> ’s arm, then looked up at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and whispered, “I don’t know what you  and your staff are playing at, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but I have  heard enough.
The  moment he had disappeared, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to  look at the group around <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“Minerva,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning to Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “I want to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> in my office as  soon as possible.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made sure that the door was closed, and  that Madam Pomfrey’s footsteps had died away,  before he spoke again.
It is time for you to lay aside your old  differences and trust each other.”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was asking for a near  miracle.
Time is short, and unless the few of  us who know the truth do not stand united, there is  no hope for any of us.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Very slowly — but still glaring at each other as  though each wished the other nothing but ill — Sirius  and <PER>Snape</PER> moved toward each other and shook  hands.
“Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning to <PER>Snape</PER>, “you  know what I must ask you to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Then good luck,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he watched,  with a trace of apprehension on his face, as <PER>Snape</PER>  swept wordlessly after Sirius.
I will  see all of you later.”   <PER>Harry</PER> slumped back against his pillows as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> disappeared.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Mrs.  Weasley were all looking at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE BEGINNING   When he looked back, even a month later, <PER>Harry</PER>  found he had only scattered memories of the next few  days.
He must have been happy.”   When they got to their feet, she looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>  and said, “You look after yourself, now.”      <PER>Harry</PER> seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.
From what <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told him,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had spoken to the school that morning  at breakfast.
He liked it best when he was with <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> and they were talking about other  things, or else letting him sit in silence while they  played chess.
The only  time they touched upon the subject was when <PER>Ron</PER>  told <PER>Harry</PER> about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had  with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> before going home.
“But he wants you to go back  to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, at least at first.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got his reasons,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  shaking his head darkly.
“I suppose we’ve got to trust  him, haven’t we?”   The only person apart from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that  <PER>Harry</PER> felt able to talk to was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“ <PER>Harry</PER>\”   He strode out to meet them, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a one-  armed hug, ruffled his hair, and said, “Good ter see  yeh, mate.
When he had  made tea and offered around a plate of doughy        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed  <PER>Harry</PER> closely through his beetle-black eyes.
“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at him, shocked.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me wha’ you did, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chest swelled as he looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked you to do,  <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” he asked.
“He sent Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to  ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that  night.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Think I got her persuaded.”   “Is it to do with <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> flinched at the sound of the name.
When he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the Hall, they  saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, as he  sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff  was now, and whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> had caught up with  him.
Further  along the table, sitting next to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  was <PER>Snape</PER>.
His eyes lingered on <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment  as <PER>Harry</PER> looked at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued to watch him, long after <PER>Snape</PER> had  looked away.
What was it that <PER>Snape</PER> had done on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  orders, the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had returned?
And  why ... why ... was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so convinced that  <PER>Snape</PER> was truly on their side?
<PER>Snape</PER> had  turned spy against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “at great personal  risk.” Was that the job he had taken up again?
Pretended that he had never really gone over to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that he had been, like <PER>Voldemort</PER>  himself, biding his time?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s musings were ended by Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who stood up at the staff table.
“The end,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking around at them  all, “of another year.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff  table.
I think that you have the right, therefore, to  know exactly how it came about.”   <PER>Harry</PER> raised his head and stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “The Ministry of Magic,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued, “does  not wish me to tell you this.
Over at the Slytherin table, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER> muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I am talking, of course, about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”   A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads  turned in <PER>Harry</PER>’s direction before flicking back to face  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter managed to escape Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He showed, in every  respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever  shown in facing Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and for this, I honor  him.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned gravely to <PER>Harry</PER> and raised his  goblet once more.
But through a  gap in the standing figures, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had      remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets  untouched.
In the light of what has happened —  of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s return — such ties are more  important than ever before.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked from Madame Maxime and  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons  students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the  Slytherin table.
Krum, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, looked wary,  almost frightened, as though he expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  to say something harsh.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting  in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the  fourth years for the carriages that would take them  back to Hogsmeade station.
Beyond her, far across  the grounds, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> helping Madame  Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their  harness.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting  back,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The carriages’ll be here in a minute!”   He let <PER>Harry</PER> keep a watch for the carriages, however,  and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over  the crowd to try and see what Krum and <PER>Hermione</PER>  might be up to.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared  at <PER>Hermione</PER>, but her face was quite impassive.
He held out his hand as Fleur had  done, shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, and then <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
Krum had already started  walking away when <PER>Ron</PER> burst out, “Can I have your  autograph?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER> turned away, smiling at the horseless  carriages that were now trundling toward them up the  drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed  a fragment of parchment for <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to get a compartment to  themselves.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> talked more fully and freely than they had  all week as the train sped them southward.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt  as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech at the Leaving Feast  had unblocked him, somehow.
They broke off their  conversation about what action <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might be  taking, even now, to stop <PER>Voldemort</PER> only when the  lunch trolley arrived.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at it, unsure whether he really  wanted to know what it might say, but <PER>Hermione</PER>,  seeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing  in there.
If you ask me, Fudge  is forcing them to keep quiet.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that <PER>Hermione</PER> had been  dying to tell them this for days, but that she had  restrained herself in light of everything else that had  happened.
She  can turn — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her  bag.
“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard  <PER>Hagrid</PER> telling Madame Maxime about his mum!”   “Exactly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
She’s been buzzing around for  stories all year.”   “When we saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> under that tree ...” said <PER>Ron</PER>  slowly.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “He was talking to her, in his hand,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
They  wouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as  long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us  and <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> took the glass jar back from <PER>Ron</PER> and  smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the  glass.
“Very clever, Granger,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Trying not to think about it, are we?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>  softly, looking around at all three of them.
He had not been this close to <PER>Malfoy</PER> since he had  watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech about Cedric.
I told you not to hang around with  riffraff like this!” He jerked his head at <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were on their  feet, all three of them having used a different hex.
Well,  let’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the  decor.”   <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed  the unconscious <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of  whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of  jinxes with which they had been hit — out into the  corridor, then came back into the compartment and  rolled the door shut.
But <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept on asking, and  finally, Fred said, “All right, all right, if you really  want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Bagman?” said <PER>Harry</PER> sharply.
About how  Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  struggled out past <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle,  carrying their trunks.
I’ve got a feeling we’re going to  need them more than usual before long.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag  in his hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons  in here.”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” Fred began, but <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out his wand.
Buy <PER>Ron</PER> some different dress robes and say they’re  from you.”   He left the compartment before they could say  another word, stepping over <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and  Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex  marks.
She hugged <PER>Harry</PER> very  tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, “I  think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will let you come to us later in the  summer.
Keep in touch, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping him on the back.
“ ’Bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and she did something  she had never done before, and kissed him on the  cheek.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through  the open window, Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s uncle,  suddenly spoke.
The <PER>Dursley</PER>s  really were astonishingly stupid about their son,  <PER>Dudley</PER>; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies  about having tea with a different member of his gang  every night of the summer holidays.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew  perfectly well that <PER>Dudley</PER> had not been to tea  anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening  vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners,  and throwing stones at passing cars and children.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a  gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car  and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and  the sound of breaking china came from the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’  living room, and as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been waiting  for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time  pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden  wand as if he were unsheathing a sword.
“Now\ Before — anyone — sees!”   “Get — off — me!” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped; for a few seconds  they struggled, <PER>Harry</PER> pulling at his uncle’s sausage-  like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a  firm grip on his raised wand.
Then, as the pain in the  top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head gave a particularly nasty throb,  Uncle Vernon yelped and released <PER>Harry</PER> as though he  had received an electric shock — some invisible force  seemed to have surged through his nephew, making  him impossible to hold.
You know  perfectly well that your lot ...”   “Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle  Vernon lowered his voice so that <PER>Harry</PER> could barely  hear him, "... that your lot don’t get on our news!”   “That’s all you know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his temper  rising, and before the <PER>Dursley</PER>s could call him back,  he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn,  stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off  up the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> merely glanced at the  front page before throwing it aside these days; when  the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back it would be headline news, and  that was the only kind <PER>Harry</PER> cared about.
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying  letters from his best friends, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  though any expectation he had had that their letters  would bring him news had long since been dashed.
As  far as <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from the vague hints in their  letters, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were in the same place,  presumably at <PER>Ron</PER>’s parents’ house.
And what were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> busy with?
Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how  <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as  empty of proper news as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, but at         least they contained words of caution and consolation  instead of tantalizing hints:   “ I know this must be frustrating for you...” “Keep your  nose clean and everything will be okay...” “Be careful  and don’t do anything rash...”   Well, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as he crossed Magnolia  Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed  toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large)  done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the  temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set  off for the Burrow by himself.
In fact <PER>Harry</PER> thought  his behavior had been very good considering how  frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet  Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in  the hope of hearing something that might point to  what Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> was doing.
Often the old scar on his forehead  prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself  that <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> or Sirius would find that very  interesting anymore...
In the past his scar hurting  had warned that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was getting stronger  again, but now that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back they would  probably remind him that its regular irritation was  only to be expected...
Why had <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> got together without  inviting him along too?
The figure in front  was unmistakably his cousin, <PER>Dudley</PER> <PER>Dursley</PER>,  wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful  gang.
“The noble sport,” as  Uncle Vernon called it, had made <PER>Dudley</PER> even more  formidable than he had seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> in the  primary school days when he had served as <PER>Dudley</PER>’s  first punching bag.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not remotely afraid of  his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that  <PER>Dudley</PER> learning to punch harder and more accurately  was cause for celebration.
If <PER>Dudley</PER>’s friends saw him sitting here, they would  be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would  <PER>Dudley</PER> do then?
and if any of the others tried  hitting <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was ready — he had his wand .
Uncle Vernon had  threatened to lock <PER>Harry</PER> in the shed if he came home  after <PER>Dudley</PER> again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling,  <PER>Harry</PER> set off toward the park gate.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER>  enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was  making <PER>Dudley</PER>; he felt as though he was siphoning  off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet  he had.
Is his ickle boxing  champ frightened of nasty <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand?”   “Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pointing  the wand directly at <PER>Dudley</PER>’s heart.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel  fourteen years’ hatred of <PER>Dudley</PER> pounding in his  veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, to jinx  <PER>Dudley</PER> so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an  insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers —   “Don’t ever talk about that again,” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s terrified voice broke in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
Ill h-hit you, I swear I  will!”   “<PER>Dudley</PER>, shut — ”   WHAM   A fist made contact with the side of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head,  lifting <PER>Harry</PER> off his feet.
“You moron, <PER>Dudley</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, his eyes watering  with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees,  now feeling around frantically in the blackness.
I have never died...”   He was never going to see <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again —   And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he  fought for breath —   “EXPECTO PATRONUM”   An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of  <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the  place where the heart should have been; it was  thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the  stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike  and defeated.
DUDLEY!”   He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached  them: <PER>Dudley</PER> was curled on the ground, his arms  clamped over his face; a second dementor was  crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its  slimy hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly  apart, lowering its hooded head toward <PER>Dudley</PER>’s face  as though about to kiss him...   “GET IT!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring  sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping  back past him.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground,  quick!”   “You know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at her.
“Of course I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who doesn’t know  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
“I’ll do it.” <PER>Harry</PER> took hold of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s arm and  heaved: With an enormous effort he managed to hoist  <PER>Dudley</PER> to his feet.
<PER>Dudley</PER> seemed to be on the point  of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets  and sweat was beading his face; the moment <PER>Harry</PER> let  go of him he swayed dangerously.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled one of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s massive arms around  his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road,       sagging slightly under his weight.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave his cousin  an impatient dig in the ribs, but <PER>Dudley</PER> seemed to  have lost all desire for independent movement.
How am I  going to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what’s happened, I can’t  Apparate — ”         “I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” <PER>Harry</PER> groaned,  wondering whether his spine was going to snap under  <PER>Dudley</PER>’s weight.
“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER>.
“Now come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, what are you waiting  for?”   <PER>Harry</PER> decided not to waste his remaining breath on  pointing out that he could barely walk under <PER>Dudley</PER>’s       bulk.
and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said we were to keep you from doing  magic at all costs... Well, it’s no good crying over  spilled potion, I suppose ... but the cat’s among the  pixies now ...”   “So,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s ... been having ...  me followed?”   “Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently.
“Wait!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted after her; he had a million  questions to ask anyone who was in contact with  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; but within seconds Mrs. Figg was  swallowed by the darkness.
Scowling, <PER>Harry</PER>       readjusted <PER>Dudley</PER> on his shoulder and made his  slow, painful way up number four’s garden path.
About time too, I was getting quite — quite —  Diddy, what’s the matter?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Dudley</PER> and ducked out  from under his arm just in time.
He managed to slip  inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door  and while the <PER>Dursley</PER>s made their noisy progress  down the hall toward the kitchen, <PER>Harry</PER> moved  carefully and quietly toward the stairs.
Tell Mummy!”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s foot was on the bottommost stair when  <PER>Dudley</PER> found his voice.
COME HERE!”   With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, <PER>Harry</PER>  removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to  follow the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
Hoping you are well,   Yours sincerely,   Mafalda Hopkirk   IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE  Ministry of Magic   <PER>Harry</PER> read the letter through twice.
<PER>Harry</PER> —   <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s  trying to sort it all out.
He was much more  tempted by the former course, but he knew that Mr.  Weasley had his best interests at heart ... and, after  all, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had sorted out much worse than this  before...   “Right,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m  staying.”       He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced  <PER>Dudley</PER> and Aunt Petunia.
Oh this explains everything,  everything, no wonder the country’s going to the  dogs...”   When <PER>Harry</PER> did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at  him, then spat, “And why have you been expelled?”   “Because I did magic.”   “AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down  on the top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of  <PER>Dudley</PER>’s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the  floor.
What did you do to <PER>Dudley</PER>?”   “Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly less calmly.
“That  wasn’t me — ”   “Was,” muttered <PER>Dudley</PER> unexpectedly, and Uncle  Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping         gestures at <PER>Harry</PER> to quiet him while they both bent  low over <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> understood:  <PER>Dudley</PER> was remembering the clammy cold that filled  the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of  you.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to <PER>Dudley</PER> to  <PER>Harry</PER> as if hoping somebody was going to shout  “April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth  yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more  words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening,  which zoomed through the still-open window like a  feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the  kitchen table, causing all three of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s to  jump with fright.
With best wishes,   Yours sincerely,   Mafalda Hopkirk       IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE     Ministry of Magic   <PER>Harry</PER> read this letter through three times in quick  succession.
He  was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a  letter to <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, or Sirius.
“<PER>Dudley</PER> and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia  Crescent and Wisteria Walk,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, speaking  fast, fighting to control his temper.
He was so convinced that this  letter had to be from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, explaining  everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the  Ministry was up to, how he, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, intended to  sort everything out — that for the first time in his life  he was disappointed to see Sirius’s handwriting.
Had the  Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had  they deserted Azkaban and joined <PER>Voldemort</PER>, as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had predicted they would?
Who must have sent them?”   “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s two lives  had somehow become fused and everything had been  turned upside down: The <PER>Dursley</PER>s were asking for  details about the magical world and Mrs. Figg knew  Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; dementors were soaring around  Little Whinging and he might never go back to  Hogwarts.
“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward  now, so that his massive purple face came closer to  <PER>Harry</PER>’s, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually felt flecks of spit hit  his face.
He addressed the first to Sirius, the  second to <PER>Ron</PER>, and the third to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
His back ached from carrying <PER>Dudley</PER>  home, and the two lumps on his head where the  window and <PER>Dudley</PER> had hit him were throbbing  painfully.
“Take these straight to Sirius,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and don’t come back here without  good long replies.
But he’d  make it up to her when she came back with Sirius’s,  <PER>Ron</PER>’s, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s answers.
“Sorry?”   “We — that is to say, your aunt, <PER>Dudley</PER>, and I — are  going out.”   “Fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER> dully, looking back at the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no particular feeling about the <PER>Dursley</PER>s  leaving.
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning <PER>Harry</PER>  toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed,  all still eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> curiously.
<PER>Harry</PER>, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and  uncle not to worry — ”   “They won’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Here you go — ”   He rapped <PER>Harry</PER> hard on the top of the head and  <PER>Harry</PER> felt a curious sensation as though Moody had  just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be  running down his body from the point the wand had  struck.
If they take out all of us and you survive,   <PER>Harry</PER>, the rear guard are standing by to take over;  keep flying east and they’ll join you.”   “Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not  taking this seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped  <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage into a harness  hanging from her broom.
“Follow Tonks, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   <PER>Harry</PER> followed Tonks into a dive.
“Here — ”       He rapped <PER>Harry</PER> hard over the head with his wand;  <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though something hot was trickling  down his back this time and knew that the  Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
“You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll  have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid...”   She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and  whispered urgently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s  started...”         The wizards behind <PER>Harry</PER> all made noises of interest  and excitement and began filing past <PER>Harry</PER> toward  the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come;  <PER>Harry</PER> made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held  him back.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are upstairs, you can wait  with them until the meeting’s over and then we’ll have  dinner.
Weasley, why — ?”       “<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> will explain everything, dear, I’ve  really got to dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered  distractedly.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged,  twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering  noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his  vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of  very bushy hair — <PER>Hermione</PER> had thrown herself onto  him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while  <PER>Ron</PER>’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round  and round their heads.
<PER>Ron</PER>, he’s here, <PER>Harry</PER>’s here!
When we heard — and that  Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve looked it  all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s  provision in the Decree for the Restriction of  Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-  threatening situations — ”   “Let him breathe, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning,  closing the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, still beaming, let go of <PER>Harry</PER>, but before  she could say another word there was a soft  whooshing sound and something white soared from  the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on  <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was going spare, she kept saying you’d do  something stupid if you were stuck all on your own  without news, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made us — ”   “ — swear not to tell me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
All of a sudden —  after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt  he would rather <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left him alone.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I mean.”   “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If he  hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  would probably have left me at Privet Drive all  summer.”         “Aren’t you ... aren’t you worried about the Ministry of  Magic hearing?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“So why’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> been so keen to keep me in the  dark?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, still trying hard to keep his voice  casual.
“We told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> we wanted to tell you what was  going on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You’re not telling me he doesn’t  know ways to send messages without owls.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER> and then said, “I thought  that too.
“So how come I have to stay at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ while  you two get to join in everything that’s going on  here?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, the words tumbling over one  another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every  word.
ME!”     <PER>Ron</PER> was standing there with his mouth half-open,  clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say,  while <PER>Hermione</PER> looked on the verge of tears.
WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME  WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING?”     “<PER>Harry</PER>, we wanted to tell you, we really did — ”  <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“CANTVE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR  YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE  MADE YOU SWEAR — ”     “Well, he did — ”   “FOUR WEEKS IVE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE,  NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND  OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON — ”     “We wanted to — ”   “I SUPPOSE YOUVE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH,  HAVENT YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER — ”   “No, honest — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, we’re really sorry!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately,  her eyes now sparkling with tears.
“You’re absolutely  right, <PER>Harry</PER> — I’d be furious if it was me!”   <PER>Harry</PER> glared at her, still breathing deeply, then  turned away from them again, pacing up and down.
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Quite a few people — ”   “ — we’ve met about twenty of them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but  we think there are more...”   <PER>Harry</PER> glared at them.
“Well what?”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>i” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, and both <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> winced.
He walked around the room again,  looking anywhere but at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Stop doing that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said weakly to the twins,  who were as vividly red-haired as <PER>Ron</PER>, though  stockier and slightly shorter.
Extendable  Ears,” he added in response to <PER>Harry</PER>’s raised  eyebrows, holding up the string, which <PER>Harry</PER> now  saw was trailing out onto the landing.
“Oh hello, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>,  brightly.
I really fancied  finding out what old <PER>Snape</PER>’s been up to.”   “<PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s  still in Romania, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants as many foreign  wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie’s trying to  make contacts on his days off.”   “Couldn’t Percy do that?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of  Mum and Dad,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> in a tense voice.
But you know Percy, Crouch left  him in charge, he wasn’t going to complain...”   “So how come they promoted him?”         “That’s exactly what we wondered,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who  seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going  now that <PER>Harry</PER> had stopped yelling.
“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s  friendly with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he’s always thought  Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle  obsession — ”   “But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>,  confused.
Dad reckons Fudge only wants  Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy  on the family — and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”     <PER>Harry</PER> let out a low whistle.
He said he’s been having to  struggle against Dad’s lousy reputation ever since he  joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no ambition  and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not  had a lot of money, I mean — ”   “ What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in disbelief, as <PER>Ginny</PER> made a  noise like an angry cat.
He said Dad was an idiot to run around with  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was heading for big  trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and  that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it  was with the Ministry.
I  dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work —  ignores him, I s’pose.”   “But Percy must know <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  slowly.
“He’s not stupid, he must know your mum  and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — ”         “Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, shooting <PER>Harry</PER> a furtive look.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried on, “Well, you’d need to read it  cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they  mention you a couple of times a week.”   “But I’d have seen — ”   “Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you  wouldn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking her head.
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this  deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a  great tragic hero or something,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very  fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for <PER>Harry</PER>  to hear these facts quickly.
If some far-fetched story  appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’ and if anyone has a funny accident or  anything it’s let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his  forehead or we’ll be asked to worship him next — ’ ”   “I don’t want anyone to worship — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began  hotly.
They  want wizards on the street to think you’re just some  stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous      tall stories because he loves being famous and wants  to keep it going.”   “I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — <PER>Voldemort</PER> killed my  parentsV’ <PER>Harry</PER> spluttered.
Don’t they think I’d rather it’d  never — ”   “We know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> earnestly.
Go and wash them before dinner, please...”   <PER>Ginny</PER> grimaced at the others and followed her mother  out of the room, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone with <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> again.
“Look ...” he muttered, but <PER>Ron</PER> shook his head, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry,  <PER>Harry</PER>, we really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to  understand, we did try and persuade <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ”   “Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grudgingly.
He cast around for a topic to change the subject from  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — the very thought of him made <PER>Harry</PER>’s  insides burn with anger again.
Never met one like him.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He’s not a nutter, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”       “His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and  stuck up on a plaque just like his mother,” said <PER>Ron</PER>  irritably.
“Is that normal, <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> still hasn’t given up on spew — ”   “It’s not ‘spew’!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> heatedly.
“It’s the  Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s  not just me, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says we should be kind to  Kreacher too — ”   “Yeah, yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“C’mon, I’m starving.”   He led the way out of the door and onto the landing,  but before they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!”  <PER>Ron</PER> breathed, flinging out an arm to stop <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> walking any farther.
In the very  center of the group <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dark, greasy-haired  head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher  at Hogwarts, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> never eats here,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
C’mon.”   “And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
I offered it to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for headquarters  — about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, who had expected a better welcome, noted how  hard and bitter Sirius’s voice sounded.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s arrived.”   “Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at <PER>Harry</PER>  through his matted ginger hair.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I haven’t seen anyone.”     “See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning  forward, a pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a  business opportunity — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt something brush against his knees and  started, but it was only Crookshanks, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once  around <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs, purring, then jumped onto  Sirius’s lap and curled up.
There’s not much I can do for the  Order of the Phoenix ... or so <PER>Dumbledore</PER> feels.”       There was something about the slightly flattened tone  of voice in which Sirius uttered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s name  that told <PER>Harry</PER> that Sirius was not very happy with  the headmaster either.
Opposite <PER>Harry</PER>, Tonks was entertaining <PER>Hermione</PER>  and <PER>Ginny</PER> by transforming her nose between  mouthfuls.
Screwing up her eyes each time with the  same pained expression she had worn back in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance  like <PER>Snape</PER>’s, shrank to something resembling a  button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of      hair from each nostril.
Apparently this was a regular  mealtime entertainment, because after a while  <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> started requesting their favorite  noses.
“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ...”   Tonks obliged, and <PER>Harry</PER>, looking up, had the fleeting  impression that a female <PER>Dudley</PER> was grinning at him  from across the table.
She  hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was  supposed to be tailing you.”   Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later  and the waistband on <PER>Harry</PER>’s jeans was feeling  uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as  the jeans had once been <PER>Dudley</PER>’s).
I thought the first thing you’d do  when you got here would be to start asking questions  about <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   The atmosphere in the room changed with the  rapidity <PER>Harry</PER> associated with the arrival of  dementors.
“I asked <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> but they said we’re not allowed in the  Order, so — ”   “And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley.
<PER>Harry</PER>, on the other hand — ”   “It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for <PER>Harry</PER>!”  said Mrs. Weasley sharply.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George’s heads turned from  Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis  rally.
“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius,  which is why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> keeps reminding you to  stay at home and — ”   “We’ll leave my instructions from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of  this, if you please!” said Sirius loudly.
He accepts that  <PER>Harry</PER> will have to be filled in to a certain extent now  that he is staying at headquarters — ”   “Yes, but there’s a difference between that and  inviting him to ask whatever he likes!”   “Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from  Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him,  hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, “I       think it better that <PER>Harry</PER> gets the facts — not all the  facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather  than a garbled version from ... others.”   His expression was mild, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure that  Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had  survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge.
I’ll  just say this: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must have had his reasons  for not wanting <PER>Harry</PER> to know too much, and  speaking as someone who has got <PER>Harry</PER>’s best  interests at heart — ”   “He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Hermione</PER> — Fred — George — I  want you out of this kitchen, now.”   There was instant uproar.
“If <PER>Harry</PER>’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but  <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>’ll tell me and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything you say  anyway!” said <PER>Ron</PER> hotly.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> considered telling <PER>Ron</PER> that  he wouldn’t tell him a single word, that he could try a  taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked  it.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  beamed.
<PER>Ginny</PER> — BED!”   <PER>Ginny</PER> did not go quietly.
“Okay, <PER>Harry</PER> ... what do you want to know?”   <PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath and asked the question that  had been obsessing him for a month.
“And you made sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew at  once.”   “How has that helped?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only one You-Know-Who was  ever scared of!”   “Thanks to you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was able to recall the  Order of the Phoenix about an hour after <PER>Voldemort</PER>  returned,” said Sirius.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be  accurate.”   “So what does <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckon he’s planning?”   “Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,”  said Sirius.
“Frightened of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  incredulously.
He thinks <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants to be  Minister of Magic.”   “But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want — ”   “Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley.
Fudge came to power instead, but he’s never quite  forgotten how much popular support <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had, even though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never applied for the  job.”   “Deep down, Fudge knows <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s much  cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard,  and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever  asking <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for help and advice,” said Lupin.
He loves being Minister of  Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that  he’s the clever one and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s simply stirring  up trouble for the sake of it.”   “How can he think that?” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“How  can he think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would just make it all up —  that I’d make it all up?”         “Because accepting that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back would  mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope  with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius bitterly.
What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily  on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they’re  calling <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s rumormongering, so most of the  Wizarding community are completely unaware  anything’s happened, and that makes them easy  targets for the Death Eaters if they’re using the  Imperius Curse.”   “But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill,  Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks.
He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s  been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in  Tibet.”   “But if none of you’s putting the news out that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s back — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began.
“Why d’you think <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s in such  trouble?”   “What d’you mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
If  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s out of the way — well, You-Know-Who  will have a clear field.”   “But if <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s trying to recruit more Death  Eaters, it’s bound to get out that he’s come back, isn’t  it?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> desperately.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t march up to people’s houses and  bang on their front doors, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not noticed her return from taking  <PER>Ginny</PER> upstairs.
All of you,” she added,  looking around at Fred, George, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
I expect <PER>Ginny</PER>’s asleep,” she  added to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “so try not to wake her up.”   “Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after  <PER>Hermione</PER> bade them good night and they were  climbing to the next floor.
“If <PER>Ginny</PER>’s not lying awake  waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER> to tell her everything they said  downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm...”   “All right, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Mrs. Weasley on the  second landing, pointing them into their bedroom.
“Off to bed with you.”   “ ’Night,” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> said to the twins.
<PER>Harry</PER> put on his pajamas, took off his  glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while <PER>Ron</PER>  threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify  Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around  and rustling their wings restlessly.
“What d’you reckon?”   <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need to ask what <PER>Ron</PER> meant.
“OUCH!”   “Keep your voice down, <PER>Ron</PER>, or Mum’ll be back up  here.”   “You two just Apparated on my knees!”   “Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George  leaping down from <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed.
“Look at <PER>Ginny</PER>.”   “What d’you mean?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
In fact,  many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and  down outside the bedroom door, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Care  of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties,  aren’ they, eh, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen  and then she needs you in the drawing room, there  are loads more doxies than she thought and she’s  found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.”   Half an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had dressed  and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a  long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive-  green walls covered in dirty tapestries.
It was around these that Mrs. Weasley,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Fred, and George were grouped, all  looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over  their noses and mouths.
“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley  said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> the moment she saw them,  pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing  on a spindle-legged table.
I’ve never  seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s  been doing for the last ten years — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but  <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at  Mrs. Weasley at these words.
He heard Sirius walking  down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the      front door, and then a deep voice he recognized as  Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved  me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave  a report for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>...”   Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head,  <PER>Harry</PER> regretfully closed the drawing room door and  rejoined the doxy party.
She won’t read the  Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling lies about  you and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> grinned.
They were crammed with an odd assortment of  objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled  snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes  inscribed with languages <PER>Harry</PER> could not understand  and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with  a large opal set into the stopper, full of what <PER>Harry</PER>  was quite sure was blood.
"... and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as  brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and  there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t know his name,  what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know ...”   “This is <PER>Harry</PER>, Kreacher,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively.
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she  is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such  company, oh what would she say — ”   “Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>  together, very angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “he’s not in  his right mind, he doesn’t know what he’s — ”   “Don’t kid yourself, <PER>Hermione</PER>, he knows exactly what  he’s saying,” said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great  dislike.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  pleadingly, “I don’t think he realizes we can hear  him.”   “He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad  orders from my mother’s portrait and talking to  himself, but he was always a foul little — ”   “If you just set him free,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hopefully,  “maybe — ”   “We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the  Order,” said Sirius curtly.
Or on <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s orders, more likely, I  doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed  by <PER>Voldemort</PER> in person.
A double line of gold  embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  and a single vertical gold line from their names led to  the name <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was  with them too.”         And <PER>Harry</PER> remembered: He had seen Bellatrix  Lestrange inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve, the strange  device in which thoughts and memories could be  stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes,  who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her  continuing allegiance to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, her pride  that she had tried to find him after his downfall and  her conviction that she would one day be rewarded  for her loyalty.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Secret-Keeper for the Order,  you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he  tells them personally where it is — that note Moody  showed you last night, that was from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>...”  Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh.
I’ve asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  whether I can escort you to your hearing — as  Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral  support, what d’you think?”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though his stomach had sunk through  the dusty carpet.
“We’ll see.”       “I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t  have to go back to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s,” <PER>Harry</PER> pressed him.
<PER>Snape</PER> might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in  <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion they were really waging war on the  house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided  and abetted by Kreacher.
<PER>Snape</PER> flitted in and out of the house  several times more, though to <PER>Harry</PER>’s relief they never  came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his  Transfiguration teacher, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,         looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though  she also seemed too busy to linger.
The idea was so terrible that  he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who, though he often saw them whispering  together and casting anxious looks in his direction,  followed his lead in not mentioning it.
A good first impression can work wonders.”   <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> all stopped  talking and looked over at him.
“When did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tell you that?” <PER>Harry</PER> said,  staring at Sirius.
Trying not to think  of the next time he would see <PER>Ron</PER>, when they might  no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>  walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of  Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.
Lupin glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then said to Tonks, “What  were you saying about Scrimgeour?”   “Oh ... yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful,  he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions...”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to  join in the conversation.
“Four stops, <PER>Harry</PER> ... three stops left now ... two  stops to go, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   They got off at a station in the very heart of London,  swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and  women carrying briefcases.
“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for  one heart-stopping moment <PER>Harry</PER> thought they had  gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley’s  continual references to the map; but a second later he  said, “Ah yes ... this way, <PER>Harry</PER>,” and led him down a  side road.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked closer to him and the wizard held up a  long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and  passed it up and down <PER>Harry</PER>’s front and back.
Have a seat,  <PER>Harry</PER>, doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet.”   <PER>Harry</PER> squeezed himself into the chair behind  Perkins’s desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the  sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given  him.
“Quick, <PER>Harry</PER>, we should have been there five  minutes ago!”   Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as  Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, <PER>Harry</PER> on his  heels.
Court Scribe,  Percy Ignatius Weasley — ”   “ — Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric  Brian <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said a quiet voice from behind  <PER>Harry</PER>, who turned his head so fast he cricked his  neck.
A powerful emotion had risen in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest at the  sight of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather  like that which phoenix song gave him.
He wanted to       catch <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eye, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not  looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the  obviously flustered Fudge.
“However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the  Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.”   “Yes — well — I suppose well need another chair — I   — Weasley, could you — ?”   “Not to worry, not to worry,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick,  and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of  nowhere next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You are <PER>Harry</PER> James Potter, of number four, Privet  Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at  <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of his parchment.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”     “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because — ”   “A corporeal Patronus?”   “A — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of  dementors in that alleyway,” he said, “other than  <PER>Dudley</PER> <PER>Dursley</PER>, I mean.”   Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though  somebody had let air out of it.
He stared down at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment or two, then, with the  appearance of a man pulling himself back together,  said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more  taradiddles, I’m afraid, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Should I — ?”         “No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who  got up at once, hurried down the stone steps from the  judge’s balcony, and hastened past <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and  <PER>Harry</PER> without glancing at them.
The dementors remain in  place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask  them to.”   “Then,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, quietly but clearly, “we  must ask ourselves why somebody within the  Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that  alleyway on the second of August.”   In the complete silence that greeted these words, the  witch to the right of Fudge leaned forward so that  <PER>Harry</PER> saw her for the first time.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only  from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two  dementors attacked <PER>Harry</PER> and his cousin a week ago,  then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry  might have ordered the attacks,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  politely.
“We are here to examine <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s  offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable  Restriction of Underage Sorcery!”   “Of course we are,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “but the  presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly  relevant.
“Then we are in agreement that <PER>Harry</PER>’s use of the  Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls  precisely into the category of exceptional  circumstances it describes?”   “If there were dementors, which I doubt — ”   “You have heard from an eyewitness,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  interrupted.
“It’s — I want this over with today,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”         “But naturally, you would not care how many times  you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a  serious miscarriage of justice,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at  school — ”   “ — but as the Ministry has no authority to punish  Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school,       <PER>Harry</PER>’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, politely as ever, but now with a  suggestion of coolness behind his words.
“As far as I am aware, however,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  continued, “there is no law yet in place that says this  court’s job is to punish <PER>Harry</PER> for every bit of magic he  has ever performed.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, seeking  reassurance; he was not at all sure that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it  was about time they made a decision.
Again, however,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER>’s attempt to  catch his eye.
THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY   <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s abrupt departure took <PER>Harry</PER>  completely by surprise.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t say — ”     “Cleared,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling the door closed behind  him, “of all charges!”   Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulders.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly,  pulling <PER>Harry</PER> aside to let them all pass, “you were  tried by the full court?”   “I think so,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
Fudge  acted as though Mr. Weasley and <PER>Harry</PER> were part of  the wall, but again, the witch looked almost  appraisingly at <PER>Harry</PER> as she passed.
He could not  believe that Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> dared look him in the face;  he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry  of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him,         when <PER>Harry</PER> had told Fudge mere weeks ago that  <PER>Malfoy</PER> was a Death Eater.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “yeah, I’m good at escaping...”   Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.
“What are you doing here anyway?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked  Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the  Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,” said  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, smoothing the front of his robes; <PER>Harry</PER>  distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded  like a full pocket of gold.
“Really, just because you are  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite boy, you must not expect the         same indulgence from the rest of us... Shall we go up  to your office, then, Minister?”   “Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on <PER>Harry</PER>  and Mr. Weasley.
I’ll leave a note  for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when I drop you off, he ought to  know <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s been talking to Fudge again.”   “What private business have they got together  anyway?”   “Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  been giving generously to all sorts of things for  years... Gets him in with the right people ... then he  can ask favors ... delay laws he doesn’t want passed  ... Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>...”   The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of  memos that flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he  pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors  clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.
Weasley,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “if Fudge is meeting  Death Eaters like <PER>Malfoy</PER>, if he’s seeing them alone,         how do we know they haven’t put the Imperius Curse  on him?”   “Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, <PER>Harry</PER>,”  muttered Mr. Weasley.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks  Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment —  which, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says, is not a lot of comfort...  Best not talk about it anymore just now, <PER>Harry</PER>...”   The doors slid open and they stepped out into the  now almost-deserted Atrium.
With a grin at the thought  of what <PER>Hermione</PER> would say if she could see the  statue of the elf, <PER>Harry</PER> turned his money bag upside  down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the  whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.
“You always  get away with stuff!”   “They were bound to clear you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  had looked positively faint with anxiety when <PER>Harry</PER>  had entered the kitchen and was now holding a  shaking hand over her eyes.
“<PER>Harry</PER> dear,  come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate  breakfast...”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat themselves down opposite him  looking happier than they had done since he had first  arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and  <PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been  somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius      <PER>Malfoy</PER>, swelled again.
“ ’Course, once <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned up on your side,  there was no way they were going to convict you,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> happily, now dishing great mounds of  mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
It happens  all the time now...”   None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them  were now helping themselves to food while gloating  over <PER>Harry</PER>’s narrow escape; Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER>  were still singing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather anxious,  but before she could say anything, <PER>Ron</PER> said happily,   “I bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turns up this evening to celebrate  with us, you know.”   “I don’t think he’ll be able to, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Mrs. Weasley,  setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of  <PER>Harry</PER>.
Sirius had  put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing  the news, wringing <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and beaming just  like the rest of them; soon, however, he was moodier  and surlier than before, talking less to everybody,  even <PER>Harry</PER>, and spending increasing amounts of time  shut up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sternly,  after <PER>Harry</PER> had confided some of his feelings to her  and <PER>Ron</PER> while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard  on the third floor a few days later.
Personally, I think he’s  being selfish.”   “That’s a bit harsh, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning as  he attempted to prize off a bit of mold that had  attached itself firmly to his finger, “you wouldn’t want  to be stuck inside this house without company.”   “He’ll have company!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He  just got his hopes up that <PER>Harry</PER> would be coming to  live here with him.”   “I don’t think that’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wringing out  his cloth.
Then you’d both be  outcasts together.”         “Come off it!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> merely shrugged.
But I sometimes think <PER>Ron</PER>’s mum’s  right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re  you or your father, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “So you think he’s touched in the head?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  heatedly.
“You know, maybe it wouldn’t be  a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to  clean all the time — we could do a sponsored scrub of  Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it  would raise awareness as well as funds — ”         “I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” <PER>Ron</PER>  muttered irritably, but only so <PER>Harry</PER> could hear him.
<PER>Harry</PER> found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts  more and more as the end of the holidays  approached; he could not wait to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> again, to  play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable  patches to the Herbology greenhouses.
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the  anti-<PER>Voldemort</PER> movement was not nearly as  interesting or exciting as <PER>Harry</PER> would have expected  before he’d experienced it.
Though members of the  Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly,  sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few  minutes’ whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made  sure that <PER>Harry</PER> and the others were kept well out of  earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody,  not even Sirius, seemed to feel that <PER>Harry</PER> needed to  know anything more than he had heard on the night  of his arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays <PER>Harry</PER> was  sweeping up Hedwig’s owl droppings from the top of  the wardrobe when <PER>Ron</PER> entered their bedroom  carrying a couple of envelopes.
“About time, I thought they’d forgotten, they usually  come much earlier than this...”   <PER>Harry</PER> swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish  bag and threw the bag over <PER>Ron</PER>’s head into the       wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it  and belched loudly.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the  Extendable Ears a few weeks back,” Fred told <PER>Harry</PER>,  “and from what they were saying, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was  having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this  year.”   “Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s  happened to the last four?” said George.
“No one in their  right mind would make <PER>Ron</PER> a prefect...”   The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them  stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Well, at least one of you’s got  their priorities right.”   He strode over to <PER>Harry</PER> and clapped him on the back  while giving <PER>Ron</PER> a scathing look.
“Prefect ... ickle <PER>Ron</PER>nie the prefect ...”   “Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George,  thrusting the prefect badge back at <PER>Ron</PER> as though it  might contaminate him.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who still had not said a word, took the badge,  stared at it for a moment, and then held it out to  <PER>Harry</PER> as though asking mutely for confirmation that  it was genuine.
“Me too, <PER>Harry</PER>, me too!”         “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, pushing the badge back into  <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“It’s <PER>Ron</PER>, not me.”     “It — what?”   “<PER>Ron</PER>’s prefect, not me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“<PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her jaw dropping.
“No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, blushing harder than ever, “no,  it’s not ... <PER>Ron</PER>’s done loads of ... he’s really ...”   The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs.  Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of  freshly laundered robes.
“His ... but ... <PER>Ron</PER>, you’re not... ?”   <PER>Ron</PER> held up his badge.
Oh,  what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry,  I’m just thrilled, oh <PER>Ron</PER>nie — ”   Fred and George were both making loud retching  noises behind her back but Mrs. Weasley did not  notice; arms tight around <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck, she was kissing  him all over his face, which had turned a brighter  scarlet than his badge.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing  and <PER>Ron</PER> muttered, “Drop it, <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   “We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said  Fred, pretending to tremble, “with these two on our  case...”   “Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally  over,” said George, shaking his head.
“Don’t pay any attention to them, <PER>Ron</PER>,  they’re only jealous!”   “I don’t think they are,” said <PER>Ron</PER> doubtfully, also  looking up at the ceiling.
I wish I could go  with Mum and choose... She’ll never be able to afford  a Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d  be great... Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the  Cleansweep, just so she knows...”       He dashed from the room, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> alone.
For some reason, <PER>Harry</PER> found that he did not want to  look at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively.
Did this make him as  arrogant as <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
That was definitely true, <PER>Harry</PER> thought; he was no  better than <PER>Ron</PER> in lessons.
What about those adventures he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had had together since they had started at  Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were with me most of the  time, said the voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
I’ve done more than either of them\   But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve  got themselves into a load of dangerous situations...  Maybe he chooses them for other reasons... <PER>Ron</PER> must  have something you don’t...   <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes and stared through his fingers  at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred  had said.
“No one in their right mind would make <PER>Ron</PER> a  prefect...”   <PER>Harry</PER> gave a small snort of laughter.
<PER>Ron</PER> had not asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to give him the  prefect badge.
Was he,   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>’s best friend in the world, going to sulk  because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins  behind <PER>Ron</PER>’s back, ruin this for <PER>Ron</PER> when, for the  first time, he had beaten <PER>Harry</PER> at something?
At this point <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s footsteps on the stairs  again.
“Listen — <PER>Ron</PER>  — well done, mate.”       The smile faded off <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER>  noticed that <PER>Ron</PER> kept moving his prefect’s badge  around, first placing it on his bedside table, then  putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and  laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the  effect of the red on the black.
“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down  dinner,” she told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George,  and <PER>Ginny</PER> as they entered the room.
“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at  <PER>Ron</PER> with his normal eye, “authority figures always  attract trouble, but I suppose <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks you  can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn’t have  appointed you...”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked rather startled at this view of the matter  but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival  of his father and eldest brother.
“To  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, the new Gryffindor prefects!”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed as everyone drank to  them and then applauded.
<PER>Ginny</PER> laughed; <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though she did  not know whether to smile or not and compromised  by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and  choking on it.
“What about you, Sirius?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked, thumping  <PER>Hermione</PER> on the back.
"... getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-  looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn’t  it, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Oh — I dunno — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly alarmed at  being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in  the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled  in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw <PER>Harry</PER>, but  Fred winked and beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust <PER>Harry</PER>,  he’s our financial backer.”   “Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding  out his hand to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect  <PER>Ron</PER>, we’re okay.”   “But Moody could have his eye on you,” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed  out.
That’s Frank and  Alice Longbottom — ”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as  he looked at Alice Longbottom; he knew her round,  friendly face very well, even though he had never met  her, because she was the image of her son, <PER>Neville</PER>.
“That’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s brother, Aberforth, only time I  ever met him, strange bloke ... That’s Dorcas  Meadowes, <PER>Voldemort</PER> killed her personally ... Sirius,  when he still had short hair ... and ... there you go,  thought that would interest you!”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart turned over.
His mother and father were  beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small,  watery-eyed man <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once as  Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their  whereabouts to <PER>Voldemort</PER> and so helped bring about  their deaths.
And then, to see them surrounded by all those other  happy faces ... Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in  bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero,  and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into  madness ... all waving happily out of the photograph  forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed...  Well, Moody might find that interesting ... he, <PER>Harry</PER>,  found it disturbing...   <PER>Harry</PER> tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed  elf heads, glad to be on his own again, but as he  approached the first landing he heard noises.
All the air seemed to vanish from <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs; he  felt as though he were falling through the floor; his  brain turned icy cold — <PER>Ron</PER> dead, no, it couldn’t be     But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — <PER>Ron</PER> was  downstairs —   “Mrs.
And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed,  who’s g-g-going to look after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>?”   “Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly.
“And as for who’s going to look after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> if  you and Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly,  “what do you think we’d do, let them starve?”   Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.
His parents wove  in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs.  Weasley sobbed over Kreacher’s dead body watched  by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were wearing crowns, and  yet again <PER>Harry</PER> found himself walking down a  corridor ending in a locked door.
From  what he heard as he dressed at top speed, <PER>Harry</PER>  gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their  trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying  them, with the result that they had hurtled straight  into <PER>Ginny</PER> and knocked her down two flights of stairs  into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both  screaming at the top of their voices.
COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY,  YOU IDIOTS — ”   FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE  HOUSE OF MY FATHERS — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> came hurrying into the room looking  flustered just as <PER>Harry</PER> was putting on his trainers;  Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was  carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl  fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her  cage — “are you ready yet?”   “Nearly — <PER>Ginny</PER> all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, shoving on  his glasses.
“I thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> was  supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s  going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do  me in?”   “I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> distractedly, looking at her watch.
<PER>Harry</PER>  seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her  cage, and set off downstairs after <PER>Hermione</PER>, dragging  his trunk.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted  Mrs. Weasley over the repeated screeches of  “MUDBLOODSl SCUM CREATURES OF DIRV.” “Leave  your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with  the luggage... Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said no!”   A bearlike black dog had appeared at <PER>Harry</PER>’s side as  <PER>Harry</PER> clambered over the various trunks cluttering  the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley.
“Don’t think we were followed...”   Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform  with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
If  in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.”         “It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks,  hugging <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Onto the train, now, hurry...”   For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto  its hind legs and placed its front paws on <PER>Harry</PER>’s  shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved <PER>Harry</PER> away  toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake act  more like a dog, Sirius!”   “See you!” <PER>Harry</PER> called out of the open window as the  train began to move, while <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>  waved beside him.
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks.
“We’re — well — <PER>Ron</PER> and I are supposed to go into  the prefect carriage,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said awkwardly.
<PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t looking at <PER>Harry</PER>; he seemed to have  become intensely interested in the fingernails on his  left hand.
“Well, I-I might see you later,  then.”   “Yeah, definitely,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, casting a shifty, anxious  look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
But  as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> dragged their trunks,  Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the  engine end of the train, <PER>Harry</PER> felt an odd sense of  loss.
“Come on,” <PER>Ginny</PER> told him, “if we get a move on we’ll  be able to save them places.”   “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one  hand and the handle of his trunk in the other.
In the very last carriage they met <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom,  <PER>Harry</PER>’s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face  shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and  maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad,  Trevor.
I can’t find a seat...”   “What are you talking about?” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, who had  squeezed past <PER>Neville</PER> to peer into the compartment  behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once why  <PER>Neville</PER> had chosen to pass this compartment by.
Her eyes ranged  over <PER>Neville</PER> and came to rest on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> stowed the three trunks and  Hedwig’s cage in the luggage rack and sat down.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> looked  at each other with their eyebrows raised.
“Another Remembrall?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering the  marblelike device <PER>Neville</PER>’s grandmother had sent him  in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.
I’m going to  see if I can breed from it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Neville</PER>’s favorite subject was  Herbology, but for the life of him he could not see  what he would want with this stunted little plant.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, who had flung her arms up in front of her face  just in time, merely looked as though she was  wearing a slimy green hat, but <PER>Harry</PER>, whose hands  had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor,  received a face full.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not turn up for nearly an  hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone  by.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> had finished their  Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate       Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and  they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a  shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.
“I’m starving,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, stowing Pigwidgeon next to  Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from <PER>Harry</PER> and  throwing himself into the seat next to him.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” replied <PER>Harry</PER> at once, his worst fear  confirmed.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared  at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few  seconds, then looked around at <PER>Ginny</PER> for some kind  of explanation, but <PER>Ginny</PER> had stuffed her knuckles in  her mouth to stop herself giggling.
“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so  often,” he told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>, “and we can give out  punishments if people are misbehaving.
I can’t wait to  get Crabbe and Goyle for something...”   “You’re not supposed to abuse your position, <PER>Ron</PER>!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“Yeah, right, because <PER>Malfoy</PER> won’t abuse it at all,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> sarcastically.
“So you’re going to descend to his level?”   “No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before  he gets mine.”   “For heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”         “I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates  writing,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily.
Upside down it  had been hard to tell what the picture on the front  was, but <PER>Harry</PER> now realized it was a fairly bad  cartoon of Cornelius Fudge; <PER>Harry</PER> only recognized  him because of the lime-green bowler hat.
“Anything good in there?” asked <PER>Ron</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> closed  the magazine.
“Of course not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> scathingly, before  <PER>Harry</PER> could answer, “ The Quibbler’s rubbish,  everyone knows that.”   “Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost  its dreamy quality.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; he had expected this, but  that did not make the sight of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> smirking  at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle  any more enjoyable.
“You see, I, unlike  you, have been made a prefect, which means that I,  unlike you, have the power to hand out  punishments.”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so  get out and leave us alone.”   <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> laughed.
“Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
Sniggering, <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a last malicious look  and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his  wake.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slammed the compartment door  behind them and turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew  at once that she, like him, had registered what <PER>Malfoy</PER>  had said and been just as unnerved by it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not talk freely in front of <PER>Neville</PER> and  Luna.
What if Mr.  <PER>Malfoy</PER> had noticed the black dog and told <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  what if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin,  Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding?
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> checking how it looked in the  black window.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from  the carriage again, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and the others to  look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to <PER>Harry</PER>,  reaching out for Pigwidgeon as <PER>Neville</PER> stowed Trevor  carefully in an inside pocket.
All first years to me!”   A lantern came swinging toward <PER>Harry</PER> and by its light  he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of  Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken  over <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a  while the previous year.
“I don’t know,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, “but we’d better get out of  the way, we’re blocking the door.”   “Oh yeah ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> became separated as they moved off  along the platform and out through the station.
Jostled by the crowd, <PER>Harry</PER> squinted through the  darkness for a glimpse of <PER>Hagrid</PER>; he had to be here,  <PER>Harry</PER> had been relying on it — seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> again  had been one of the things to which he had been  looking forward most.
He looked around for <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>, wanting to  know what they thought about the reappearance of  Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was  anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be  shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road  outside Hogsmeade station.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly at them, turned  away to keep a lookout for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, then  did a double take.
“Where’s Pig?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  turning quickly, eager to consult <PER>Ron</PER> about <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“He’d better be okay...”   A short distance away, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, followed by a  small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and  Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking  second years out of the way so that they could get a  coach to themselves.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> was being absolutely foul to a first year back  there, I swear I’m going to report him, he’s only had  his badge three minutes and he’s using it to bully  people worse than ever... Where’s Crookshanks?”   “<PER>Ginny</PER>’s got him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, relieving <PER>Ginny</PER> of the cat.
“Come on, let’s get a carriage together before they all  fillup...”   “I haven’t got Pig yet!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was  already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied  coach.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained behind with <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well,  come on then, let’s get in... what were you saying,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I was saying, what are those horse things?” <PER>Harry</PER>  said, as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Luna made for the carriage in  which <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were already sitting.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a perplexed  look.
“What are you talking about?”   “I’m talking about — look!”   <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm and wheeled him about so  that he was face-to-face with the winged horse.
<PER>Ron</PER>  stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at  <PER>Harry</PER>.
It’s right there in front — ”   But as <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look bemused, a strange  thought occurred to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you feeling all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I ... yeah ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt utterly bewildered.
Yet unless <PER>Ron</PER>  was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was —  <PER>Ron</PER> could not see it at all.
“Shall we get in, then?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, looking  at <PER>Harry</PER> as though worried about him.
“Yeah, go on ...”   “It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside <PER>Harry</PER>  as <PER>Ron</PER> vanished into the coach’s dark interior.
“He isn’t a  very good teacher, is he?”   “Yes, he is!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared at <PER>Hermione</PER>; she cleared her throat and  quickly said, “Erm ... yes ... he’s very good.”   “Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said  Luna, unfazed.
When they passed between the tall stone  pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the  gates to the school grounds, <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward to  try and see whether there were any lights on in  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the  grounds were in complete darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> had once before had the experience of seeing  something that <PER>Ron</PER> could not, but that had been a  reflection in a mirror, something much more  insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking  beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages.
If  Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been  there but invisible; why, then, could <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly  see them, and why could <PER>Ron</PER> not?
The moment they reached Gryffindor’s, <PER>Ginny</PER> was  hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with  them; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> found seats  together about halfway down the table between Nearly  Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and  Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of  whom gave <PER>Harry</PER> airy, overly friendly greetings that  made him quite sure they had stopped talking about  him a split second before.
“He’s not there.”       <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> scanned the staff table too, though  there was no real need; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s size made him  instantly obvious in any lineup.
“But where is he, then?”   There was a pause, then <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly, so  that <PER>Neville</PER>, Parvati, and Lavender could not hear,  “Maybe he’s not back yet.
You know — from his  mission — the thing he was doing over the summer  for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Yeah ... yeah, that’ll be it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding  reassured, but <PER>Hermione</PER> bit her lip, looking up and  down the staff table as though hoping for some  conclusive explanation of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s absence.
“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not understand what she was talking about  but did not ask; his attention had just been caught by  Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared  behind the staff table; she worked her way along to  the very end and took the seat that ought to have  been <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick  knowledgeably, leaning across <PER>Neville</PER> toward her  (<PER>Neville</PER> winced, it was very uncomfortable to have a  ghost lean through you).
With a last frowning look that  swept the four House tables, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and  called out,   “Abercrombie, Euan.”   The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER> had noticed earlier  stumbled forward and put the hat on his head; it was  only prevented from falling right down to his  shoulders by his very prominent ears.
Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the  pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat’s  decisions, <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Ron</PER>’s stomach rumbling  loudly.
Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into       Hufflepuff, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> picked up the  hat and stool and marched them away as Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rose to his feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> was somehow soothed to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  standing before them all, whatever his recent bitter  feelings toward his headmaster.
“Of  course, it lives in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, so I daresay it  picks things up there.”   “And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, looking over at the Slytherin table, where  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was holding court.
But I  am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I  assure you!”   “Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, throwing a furious look at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well done, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“First years ought to know that the  forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students —  and a few of our older students ought to know by now  too.” (<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged smirks.)
We  are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-  Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures  lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor  Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher.”   There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic  applause during which <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  exchanged slightly panicked looks; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would be  teaching.
Professor Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her  flyaway hair, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s mouth was  as thin as <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s dark eyebrows had  contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and  <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance  with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little  “Hem, hem” and went on with her speech.
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” <PER>Ron</PER> said  quietly, turning a glazed face upon <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, we’re supposed to show the first years where to  go!”   “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had obviously forgotten.
Midgets!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>\”   “Well, they are, they’re titchy...”   “I know, but you can’t call them midgets... First  years!” <PER>Hermione</PER> called commandingly along the  table.
“See you later,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and he  made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing       everything he could to ignore more whispering,  staring, and pointing as he passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I know it!” someone panted from behind him,  and he turned to see <PER>Neville</PER> jogging toward him.
“Mimbulus  mimbletonio 1”   “Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung  open toward them like a door, revealing a circular         hole in the wall behind, through which <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Neville</PER> now climbed.
Then he said, with his back still turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Me  mam didn’t want me to come back.”   “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pausing in the act of pulling off  his robes.
“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes,  “she ... er ... well, it’s not just you, it’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  too ...”   “She believes the Daily Prophet?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If you’ve got a problem sharing a  dormitory with me, go and ask <PER>McGonagall</PER> if you can  be moved, stop your mummy worrying — ”   “Leave my mother out of this, Potter!”       “What’s going on?”   <PER>Ron</PER> had appeared in the doorway.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t do that — we met  your mother, we liked her...”   “That’s before she started believing every word the  stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!” said <PER>Harry</PER> at  the top of his voice.
<PER>Ron</PER> glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and  <PER>Neville</PER>.
She says if  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says he’s back, he’s back.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a rush of gratitude toward <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay back on his pillows while <PER>Ron</PER> bustled  around the next bed, putting his things away.
Was it anger at <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps, that had  stopped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> getting in touch with him for  months?
The two of them were in this together, after  all; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had believed <PER>Harry</PER>, announced his  version of events to the whole school and then to the  wider Wizarding community.
Anyone who thought  <PER>Harry</PER> was a liar had to think that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was  too or else that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been hoodwinked...   They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought <PER>Harry</PER>  miserably, as <PER>Ron</PER> got into bed and extinguished the  last candle in the dormitory.
<PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both gave <PER>Harry</PER> it’s-his-problem-not-  yours looks, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not much consoled.
“What’s the matter?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> five minutes  later, catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> halfway across  the common room as they all headed toward        breakfast.
“We’ll have to talk to them, <PER>Ron</PER>.”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked positively alarmed.
“It’s up to us to  stop this kind of thing!”   <PER>Ron</PER> said nothing; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from his glum  expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and       George doing exactly what they liked was not one that  he found inviting.
“Anyway, what’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> continued, as  they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits  of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them,  being engrossed in their own conversation.
“You look  really angry about something.”   “Seamus reckons <PER>Harry</PER>’s lying about You-Know-  Who,” said <PER>Ron</PER> succinctly, when <PER>Harry</PER> did not  respond.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had expected to react angrily  on his behalf, sighed.
And it would be  quite nice if you stopped jumping down <PER>Ron</PER>’s and my  throats, <PER>Harry</PER>, because if you haven’t noticed, we’re  on your side.”   There was a short pause.
“Don’t you remember what  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said at the end-of-term feast last year?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both looked at her blankly, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed again.
“I listen, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a touch of  asperity.
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what — ”   “The point,” <PER>Hermione</PER> pressed on loudly, “is that this  sort of thing is exactly what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was talking  about.
And the  Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand  together, be united — ”   “And <PER>Harry</PER> said it last night,” retorted <PER>Ron</PER>, “if that  means we’re supposed to get matey with the  Slytherins, fat chance.”   “Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of  inter-House unity,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> crossly.
“What?” said both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
“Well ... maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to  <PER>Hagrid</PER> not being here.”   “What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  half laughing.
“How could we not notice?”   Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, a tall black girl with  long, braided hair had marched up to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely,  sitting down beside <PER>Ron</PER> and pulling a plate of toast  toward her.
“What are you still getting that for?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  irritably, thinking of Seamus, as <PER>Hermione</PER> placed a  Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s leg and it took  off again.
“I’m not bothering ... load of rubbish.”   “It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper  and disappeared behind it, not emerging until <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> had finished eating.
“Nothing about you  or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> or anything.”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was now moving along the table  handing out schedules.
“Cheers,” said <PER>Ron</PER> moodily, pocketing his schedule,  “but I think I’ll take the lessons.”   “And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, eyeing Fred and George beadily, “you can’t  advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board.”       “Says who?” said George, looking astonished.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>.”   “Leave me out of it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hastily.
“What did that mean?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking from  <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER>.
What about you, <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “I don’t know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
further ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> carefully avoided looking at each  other.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had  so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only  by copying <PER>Hermione</PER>’s notes before exams; she alone  seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns ’s  voice.
<PER>Harry</PER>       heard just enough within the first ten minutes to  appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this  subject might have been mildly interesting, but then  his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining  thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of  his parchment with <PER>Ron</PER>, while <PER>Hermione</PER> shot them  filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> chose a  secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony,  turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly  September air and talking about what <PER>Snape</PER> was  likely to set them in the first lesson of the year.
“So did you ... er ... have a good summer?”   The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t:  Cedric had been Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of  his death must have affected her holiday almost as  badly as it had affected <PER>Harry</PER>’s... Something seemed  to tauten in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all  right, you know...”   “Is that a Tornados badge?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded suddenly,  pointing at the front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky-  blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T was  pinned.
“Have you always supported them, or just since they  started winning the league?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER>  considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.
<PER>Hermione</PER> waited until Cho was  halfway across the courtyard before rounding on <PER>Ron</PER>.
I wasn’t attacking her, I was only — ”   “Who cares if she supports the Tornados?”   “Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those  badges only bought them last season — ”   “But what does it matter?”   “It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping  on the bandwagon — ”   “That’s the bell,” said <PER>Harry</PER> listlessly, because <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> were bickering too loudly to hear it.
They did not stop arguing all the way down to <PER>Snape</PER>’s  dungeon, which gave <PER>Harry</PER> plenty of time to reflect  that between <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> he would be lucky ever  to have two minutes’ conversation with Cho that he  could look back on without wanting to leave the  country.
He filed into the classroom behind <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> and followed them to their usual table at  the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now  issuing from both of them.
Be  warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the  ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and  sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay  close attention to what you are doing.” On <PER>Harry</PER>’s  left, <PER>Hermione</PER> sat up a little straighter, her  expression one of the utmost attentiveness.
“The  ingredients and method” — <PER>Snape</PER> flicked his wand —  “are on the blackboard” — (they appeared there) —  “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his  wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of  the said cupboard sprang open) — “you have an hour  and a half... Start.”   Just as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had predicted,  <PER>Snape</PER> could hardly have set them a more difficult,  fiddly potion.
The surface of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s potion, however, was a  shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as <PER>Snape</PER> swept  by he looked down his hooked nose at it without  comment, which meant that he could find nothing to  criticize.
At <PER>Harry</PER>’s cauldron, however, <PER>Snape</PER>  stopped, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER> with a horrible smirk  on his face.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”   The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up  eagerly; they loved hearing <PER>Snape</PER> taunt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Tell me, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “can you read?”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> laughed.
His potion had  been no worse than <PER>Ron</PER>’s, which was now giving off a       foul odor of bad eggs, or <PER>Neville</PER>’s, which had achieved  the consistency of just-mixed cement and which  <PER>Neville</PER> was now having to gouge out of his cauldron,  yet it was he, <PER>Harry</PER>, who would be receiving zero  marks for the day’s work.
When at long last the  bell rang, <PER>Harry</PER> was first out of the dungeon and had  already started his lunch by the time <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him in the Great Hall.
“That was really unfair,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> consolingly,  sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER> and helping herself to  shepherd’s pie.
“Your potion wasn’t nearly as bad as  Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole thing  shattered and set his robes on fire.”   “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glowering at his plate, “since  when has <PER>Snape</PER> ever been fair to me?”   Neither of the others answered; all three of them  knew that <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>’s mutual enmity had  been absolute from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had set foot in  Hogwarts.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  was cracked trusting <PER>Snape</PER>, where’s the evidence he  ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?”       “I think <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s probably got plenty of evidence,  even if he doesn’t share it with you, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, as  <PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to argue back.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> both froze, looking angry and offended.
The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still  blazed inside him, and the vision of <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of  deep satisfaction.
<PER>Ron</PER> emerged from the trapdoor, looked  around carefully, spotted <PER>Harry</PER> and made directly for  him, or as directly as he could while having to wend  his way between tables, chairs, and overstuffed poufs.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> and me have stopped arguing,” he said,  sitting down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> says she thinks it would be nice if you  stopped taking out your temper on us,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
It’s not our fault  how Seamus and <PER>Snape</PER> treat you.”   “I never said it — ”   “Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual  misty, dreamy voice, and <PER>Harry</PER> broke off, feeling both  annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself again.
At the table next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean had paired  up with <PER>Neville</PER>, who immediately embarked on a long-  winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of  giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat;  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> merely looked at each other glumly.
He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare  about a graveyard meant, he did not need <PER>Ron</PER> or  Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell  him that...   “Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the  other night,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, screwing up his face in an  effort to remember.
When the bell went, he  and <PER>Ron</PER> led the way back down the ladder, <PER>Ron</PER>  grumbling loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember <PER>Hermione</PER> ever neglecting  to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the  temptation to open any book that came under her  nose.
After several more minutes had passed, however,  <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one watching <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The  chapter they had been instructed to read was so  tedious that more and more people were choosing to  watch <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mute attempt to catch Professor      Umbridge’s eye than to struggle on with “Basics for  Beginners.”   When more than half the class were staring at  <PER>Hermione</PER> rather than at their books, Professor  Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the  situation no longer.
“And your name is — ?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> immediately  raised their hands too.
Professor Umbridge’s pouchy  eyes lingered on <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment before she  addressed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
You have been frightened into believing that  you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —     “No we haven’t,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “we just — ”   “Your hand is not up, Miss Grangeii”   <PER>Hermione</PER> put up her hand; Professor Umbridge  turned away from her.
“Hmm, let’s think ...” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a mock thoughtful  voice, “maybe Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”   <PER>Ron</PER> gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream;  <PER>Neville</PER> slipped sideways off his stool.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered in a warning voice,  tugging at his sleeve, but <PER>Harry</PER> jerked his arm out of  her reach.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class,  for none of them, apart from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, had  ever heard <PER>Harry</PER> talk about what had happened on  the night that Cedric had died.
Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish  voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.”   He kicked his chair aside, strode around <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> and up to the teacher’s desk.
He took it from her without saying a word and left the  room, not even looking back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  and slamming the classroom door shut behind him.
“You called her a liar?”   “Yes.”   “You told her <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> is back?”  “Yes.”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sat down behind her desk,  frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And sit down.”   There had been a previous occasion when <PER>Harry</PER>,  expecting to be caned by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, had  instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor  Quidditch team.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> set down Professor Umbridge’s  note and looked very seriously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back, you know he is, Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knows he is — ”   “For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, straightening her glasses angrily (she       had winced horribly when he had used <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  name).
He  heard whispers all around him as he sat eating  between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered...”   “He reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who...”   “Come off it...”   “Who does he think he’s kidding?”   “Pur - lease ...”        “What I don’t get,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a shaking voice,  laying down his knife and fork (his hands were  trembling too much to hold them steady), “is why they  all believed the story two months ago when  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told them...”   “The thing is, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m not sure they did,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> when they  reached the first-floor landing.
“You arrived back  in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric’s dead  body... None of us saw what happened in the maze...  We just had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s word for it that You-Know-  Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought  you.”   “Which is the truth!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
“I know it is, <PER>Harry</PER>, so will you please stop biting my  head off?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> wearily.
Crookshanks uncoiled  himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them,  purring loudly, and when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt  lightly into <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s lap and curled up there like a  furry ginger cushion.
“How can <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have let this happen?”  <PER>Hermione</PER> cried suddenly, making <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.
What’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> playing at?”   “And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> darkly.
“Don’t start arguing again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily, as  <PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to retaliate.
“Shall we do <PER>Snape</PER>’s stuff first?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, dipping  his quill into his ink.
“Come on,  <PER>Ron</PER>.”   “I — what?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, plainly playing for time.
“No —  come on, <PER>Hermione</PER> — we can’t tell them off for giving  out sweets...”         “You know perfectly well that those are bits of  Nosebleed Nougat or — or Puking Pastilles or — ”   “Fainting Fancies?” <PER>Harry</PER> suggested quietly.
<PER>Ron</PER> rose  halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a  moment or two, then muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “She’s got it  under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as  his lanky frame permitted.
“Thank you for your support, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said  acidly.
“There’s no point trying to finish this now, I can’t do it  without <PER>Hermione</PER>, I haven’t got a clue what you’re  supposed to do with moonstones, have you?”   <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head, noticing as he did so that the  ache in his right temple was getting worse.
“But on the plus side, no <PER>Snape</PER> today,” said <PER>Ron</PER>  bracingly.
By the end of a double period,  neither he nor <PER>Ron</PER> had managed to vanish the snails  on which they were practicing, though <PER>Ron</PER> said  hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, successfully vanished  her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point  bonus for Gryffindor from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Now panicking slightly about the amount of  homework they had to do, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent their  lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of  moonstones in potion-making.
Still angry about <PER>Ron</PER>’s  slur on her woolly hats, <PER>Hermione</PER> did not join them.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind  them; turning, they saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> striding toward  them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin  cronies.
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly  irritating <PER>Harry</PER>: Anyone would have thought that  <PER>Hagrid</PER> never showed them impressive creatures;  admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but  the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting  enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too  much so.
Anybody know what  they eat?”   “Wood lice,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> promptly, which explained  why what <PER>Harry</PER> had taken for grains of brown rice  were moving.
Smirking  all over his pointed face, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> leaned across  <PER>Harry</PER> and seized the largest bowtruckle.
“Maybe,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in an undertone, so that only  <PER>Harry</PER> could hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got  himself badly injured.”   “Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said <PER>Harry</PER> out  of the side of his mouth.
“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for  him, if you get my drift.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> walked away, smirking over his shoulder at  <PER>Harry</PER>, who suddenly felt sick.
He hurried  back around the table to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  were squatting on the grass some distance away and  attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still  long enough to draw it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out parchment         and quill, crouched down beside the others, and  related in a whisper what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had just said.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would know if something had happened  to <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped it; Crabbe and  Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of  <PER>Hagrid</PER> being sacked, laughed still harder as the  bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little,  moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots.
When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds  <PER>Harry</PER> rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture  and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped  in a handkerchief of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s derisive  laughter still ringing in his ears.
“If he calls <PER>Hagrid</PER> a moron one more time ...” snarled  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t go picking a row with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t  forget, he’s a prefect now, he could make life difficult  for you...”   “Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult  life?” said <PER>Harry</PER> sarcastically.
<PER>Ron</PER> laughed, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> frowned.
“I just wish <PER>Hagrid</PER> would hurry up and get back,  that’s all,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low voice, as they reached  the greenhouses.
“Because she’ll never be as good as <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced  an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and  was thoroughly annoyed about it.
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe  me?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> as they made their way  into class.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, <PER>Harry</PER>, you can do better than  her,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
My  family have always stood firm behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  and so do I.”   “Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taken  aback but pleased.
Ernie’s  words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender  Brown’s face and, as he turned to talk to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> caught Seamus’s expression, which  looked both confused and defiant.
“You know what?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as  they entered the Great Hall.
You realize we’ve got to write three  essays, practice Vanishing Spells for <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the  bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream  diary for Trelawney?”   <PER>Ron</PER> moaned and for some reason glanced up at the  ceiling.
“How come you didn’t do it last night?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked,  as <PER>Ron</PER> stared wildly around the common room for  inspiration.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who had been fast asleep when  <PER>Harry</PER> got back to the dormitory, muttered something  about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his  parchment, and scrawled a few words.
What  did she make you do?”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said,  “Lines.”   “That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a  room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?”   “At least it’s only lines,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> consolingly, as  <PER>Harry</PER> sank back onto his bench and looked down at  his steak-and-kidney pie, which he no longer fancied  very much.
He was not really sure why he was not telling <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what was happening in  Umbridge ’s room: He only knew that he did not want  to see their looks of horror; that would make the  whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult  to face.
The skin on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand became  irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; <PER>Harry</PER>  thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for  long.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed  very sleepy too, though <PER>Harry</PER> could not see why he       should be.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s third detention passed in the same  way as the previous two, except that after two hours  the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the  back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, but remained scratched there,  oozing droplets of blood.
She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a  staircase to the seventh floor, she’s an evil, twisted,  mad, old —   “<PER>Ron</PER>?”   He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right,  and almost walked into <PER>Ron</PER>, who was lurking behind  a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his  broomstick.
I’ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good?”   “I’m not bad,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked immensely  relieved at <PER>Harry</PER>’s reaction.
“Yeah, so do — <PER>Harry</PER>, what’s that on the back of your  hand?”   <PER>Harry</PER>, who had just scratched his nose with his free  right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success  as <PER>Ron</PER> with his Cleans weep.
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s — ”   But <PER>Ron</PER> had grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s forearm and pulled the  back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand up level with his eyes.
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, but after all, <PER>Ron</PER> had been honest  with him, so he told <PER>Ron</PER> the truth about the hours he  had been spending in Umbridge’s office.
Go to <PER>McGonagall</PER>, say something!”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
You can’t let her get away with this!”         “I don’t know how much power <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s got over  her,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, then, tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
He was not going to go to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for help when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not  spoken to him once since last June.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> glanced toward the staff table  automatically when he entered the Great Hall, it was  without real hope of seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> and he turned his  mind immediately to his more pressing problems,  such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to  do and the prospect of yet another detention with  Umbridge.
“We can take off his name and put  yours on instead...”   As <PER>Ron</PER> moved away, Angelina came striding up to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved over to sit next to <PER>Hermione</PER>,  who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s you... Good about <PER>Ron</PER>, isn’t it?” she  said blearily.
“Listen, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I  was just up in Umbridge’s office and she touched my  arm ...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> listened closely.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished  she said slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know- Who’s  controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?”   “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dropping his voice, “it’s a  possibility, isn’t it?”   “I suppose so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though she sounded  unconvinced.
Then  <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “But last year your scar hurt when  nobody was touching you, and didn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> say  it had to do with what You- Know- Who was feeling at  the time?
“Twisted.”   “She’s horrible, yes, but ... <PER>Harry</PER>, I think you ought to  tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> your scar hurt.”         It was the second time in two days he had been  advised to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and his answer to  <PER>Hermione</PER> was just the same as his answer to <PER>Ron</PER>.
It’s been hurting on and off all  summer — it was just a bit worse tonight, that’s all —     “<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would want to be  bothered by this — ”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before he could stop himself,  “that’s the only bit of me <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cares about,  isn’t it, my scar?”   “Don’t say that, it’s not true!”   “I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he  thinks — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you can’t put something like that in a letter!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking alarmed.
Tell <PER>Ron</PER>  for me, will you?”   “Oh no,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved, “if you’re  going that means I can go without being rude too, I’m  absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more  hats tomorrow.
PERCY AND PADFOOT   <PER>Harry</PER> was the first to awake in his dormitory next  morning.
He could now appreciate how hard it had been for  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to write him letters over the  summer.
Best,   <PER>Harry</PER>   <PER>Harry</PER> reread this letter several times, trying to see it  from the point of view of an outsider.
He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about  <PER>Hagrid</PER> and tell them when he might be back: <PER>Harry</PER>  did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much  attention to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> might be up to while he was  not at Hogwarts.
He might be able to put a stop to it... See  you, <PER>Harry</PER>...”       “Yeah, ’bye,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and instead of turning right,  he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to  the Owlery.
“Morning,” <PER>Harry</PER> said brightly to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> in surprise.
“Look, I don’t think you should,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  seriously, “you’re both really behind on homework as     it — ”     But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and,  as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in  the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously  close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; <PER>Hermione</PER>  pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the  newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as  the owl took off again.
“Anything interesting?” said <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> smiled — he  knew <PER>Ron</PER> was keen to get her off the subject of  homework.
<PER>Harry</PER> devoted himself to another helping of eggs and  bacon; <PER>Ron</PER> was staring up at the high windows,  looking slightly preoccupied.
“Oh no ...  Sirius!”   “What’s happened?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he snatched at  the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle  so that he and <PER>Hermione</PER> were holding half each.
“Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’ll bet anything,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low,  furious voice.
broke out of  Azkaban ...’ the usual rubbish,” <PER>Hermione</PER> concluded,  laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully  at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did warn him not to.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he  had torn off.
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so <PER>Hermione</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> could both see it.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “look ... this little piece here ...”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> bent closer to read it; the item was  barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of  a column.
He’s one of the Ord — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, shh\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, casting a terrified look  around them.
Maybe  they’ve just made something up to get him!”   There was a pause while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  considered this.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it seemed far-fetched;  <PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, looked rather  impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at  all surprised if that were true.”   She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully.
“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for  Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re  lucky we’ll be able to start <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s Inanimatus  Conjurus before lunch...”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the  pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky  was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been  on his Firebolt for a week...   “I mean, we can do it tonight,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as he and  <PER>Harry</PER> walked down the sloping lawns toward the  Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their  shoulders, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s dire warnings that they would  fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the  changing room and set to work, <PER>Ron</PER> guarding the  three tall goalposts, <PER>Harry</PER> playing Chaser and trying  to get the Quaffle past <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Ron</PER> was  pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals  <PER>Harry</PER> attempted to put past him and played better  the longer they practiced.
<PER>Ron</PER> mounted his broom and  kicked off from the ground and <PER>Harry</PER> followed him,  watching his ears turn red from behind.
Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw  it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to  <PER>Harry</PER>, who passed to <PER>Ron</PER>, who dropped it.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to  <PER>Harry</PER>, who passed to George...   “Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
It must be, what, a  whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that’s  a record for you, isn’t it?”   Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to <PER>Harry</PER>,  who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the  very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to <PER>Ron</PER>,  who lunged for it and missed by inches.
“Come on now, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Angelina crossly, as <PER>Ron</PER>  dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle.
“It’ll clear it up in no time.”   “All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get  your bats and a Bludger; <PER>Ron</PER>, get up to the goalposts,  <PER>Harry</PER>, release the Snitch when I say so.
We’re going  to aim for <PER>Ron</PER>’s goal, obviously.”   <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.
When Angelina blew her  whistle, <PER>Harry</PER> released the Snitch and Fred and  George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on,   <PER>Harry</PER> was barely aware of what the others were  doing.
“<PER>Ron</PER> —  you’re not covering your middle post!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was hovering in  front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two  completely unprotected.
“How was practice?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> rather coolly  half an hour later, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed through  the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.
“Completely lousy,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hollow voice,  sinking into a chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” <PER>Harry</PER>  muttered, “but it was only the first training session,  like you said...”   Neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to make much  headway with their homework that night.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew  <PER>Ron</PER> was too preoccupied with how badly he had  performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was  having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are  losers” out of his head.
“You know, we probably should try and get more  homework done during the week,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to  <PER>Ron</PER>, as they finally laid aside Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s  long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and  turned miserably to Professor Sinistra ’s equally long  and difficult essay about Jupiter’s moons.
“Listen ... shall we just ask  <PER>Hermione</PER> if we can have a look at what she’s done?”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at her; she was sitting with  Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to  <PER>Ginny</PER> as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair       in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf  socks.
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,”  she said, pointing over <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulder at a line in his  Astronomy essay, “and it’s Io that’s got the volcanos.”   “Thanks,” snarled <PER>Ron</PER>, scratching out the offending  sentences.
“Sorry, I only — ”   “Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —     “<PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m up to my neck in it here — ”   “No — look!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing to the nearest window.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> both looked over.
<PER>Ron</PER> took it off and the  owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across  <PER>Ron</PER>’s drawing of the moon Io.
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  sinking back into his chair and staring at the words  on the outside of the scroll: To <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley,  Gryffindor House, Hogwarts.
He thrust the letter at  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who leaned toward each other  to read it together:   Dear <PER>Ron</PER>,   I have only just heard (from no less a person than the  Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new  teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a  Hogwarts prefect   I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this  news and must firstly offer my congratulations.
Yes, I am sure  you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say  that Potter has always been <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite —  but I feel bound to tell you that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> may not be  in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who  count have a very different — and probably more  accurate — view of Potters behavior.
It pains me to criticize our parents, but I  am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while  they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd  around <PER>Dumbledore</PER> (if you are writing to Mother at any  point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore,  who is a great friend of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, has recently  been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry.
Your brother,   Percy   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER> with an odd expression  on her face.
Ah, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you’re a lifesaver,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, “what can I — ?”         “What you can say is, ‘We promise well never leave  our homework this late again,’ ” she said, holding out  both hands for their essays, but she looked slightly  amused all the same.
“Thanks a million, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> weakly,  passing over his essay and sinking back into his  armchair, rubbing his eyes.
And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, <PER>Harry</PER>  thought that Sirius was probably the only person he  knew who could really understand how he felt at the  moment, because Sirius was in the same situation;       nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius  a dangerous murderer and a great <PER>Voldemort</PER>  supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge  for fourteen years...   <PER>Harry</PER> blinked.
He had imagined it because he had been  thinking about Sirius...   “Okay, write that down,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>,  pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own  writing back to <PER>Ron</PER>, “and then copy out this  conclusion that I’ve written for you.”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, you are honestly the most wonderful  person I’ve ever met,” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly, “and if I’m  ever rude to you again — ”   “ — I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I  think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra,  Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> had slid off his chair onto his knees and was  now crouching on the singed and threadbare  hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
“Er — <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly.
“This was the only  way I could come up with of answering <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter  without resorting to a code — and codes are  breakable.”   At the mention of <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  had both turned to stare at him.
“Anyway,  we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed —  your scar.”   “What about — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said  quickly, “We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.”   “Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we  don’t think it’s anything to really worry about.
It kept  aching all last year, didn’t it?”   “Yeah, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said it happened whenever  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was feeling a powerful emotion,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring, as usual, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  winces.
“I know her by reputation and  I’m sure she’s no Death Eater — ”   “She’s foul enough to be one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly and  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded vigorously in agreement.
Imagine wasting your time and  energy persecuting merpeople when there are little  toerags like Kreacher on the loose — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> laughed but <PER>Hermione</PER> looked upset.
“Is she training you all to kill half-  breeds?”         “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s affronted look  at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher.
“What does he think we’re doing here, forming some  sort of wizard army?”   “That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said  Sirius, “or rather, that’s exactly what he’s afraid  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s doing — forming his own private army,  with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of  Magic.”   There was a pause at this, then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “That’s the  stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff  that Luna Lovegood comes out with.”   “So we’re being prevented from learning Defense  Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll  use spells against the Ministry?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  looking furious.
It’s a matter  of time before he has <PER>Dumbledore</PER> arrested on some  trumped-up charge.”   This reminded <PER>Harry</PER> of Percy’s letter.
“So you haven’t had any news about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, either?”   “Ah ...” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back  by now, no one’s sure what’s happened to him.” Then,  seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, “But  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s not worried, so don’t you three get  yourselves in a state; I’m sure <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fine.”   “But if he was supposed to be back by now ...” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small, worried voice.
“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch  with her and she says they got separated on the  journey home — but there’s nothing to suggest he’s  hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly  okay.”   Unconvinced, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged  worried looks.
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about  <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more  attention to the fact that he’s not back, and I know  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want that.
I thought I  could — ”     “NO!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, very loudly.
“Something <PER>Malfoy</PER> said on the train made us think he  knew it was you, and his father was on the platform,  Sirius — you know, Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> — so don’t come  up here, whatever you do, if <PER>Malfoy</PER> recognizes you  again — ”   “All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius.
However, the  departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of  the milk jug when <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a huge gasp and  flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph  of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking  slowly at them from beneath the headline:   MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM   DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER  “HIGH INQUISITOR”   “ “High Inquisitor’?” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly, his half-eaten  bit of toast slipping from his fingers.
‘<PER>Dumbledore</PER> couldn’t find anyone, so the  Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an  immediate success — ’ ”   “She’s been a WHAT?” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
“ ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is being subjected to fair and objective  evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, 41, speaking from  his Wiltshire mansion last night.
‘Many of us with our  children’s best interests at heart have been concerned  about some of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eccentric decisions in the  last few years and will be glad to know that the  Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’   “Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the  controversial staff appointments previously described  in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of  werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and  delusional ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
‘This is a  further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.’ (For a full account of Madam  Marchbanks’ alleged links to subversive goblin groups,  turn to page 17].”   <PER>Hermione</PER> finished reading and looked across the  table at the other two.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, staring at  him.
“Oh, I can’t wait to see <PER>McGonagall</PER> inspected,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> happily.
“Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her.”   “Well, come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, jumping up, “we’d  better get going, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we  don’t want to be late...”         But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their  History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the  previous Monday, nor was she in <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon  when they arrived for double Potions, where <PER>Harry</PER>’s  moonstone essay was handed back to him with a  large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner.
Ha!”   <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Hermione</PER> was looking sideways to  see what grade he had received; he slid his  moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as  possible, feeling that he would rather keep that  information private.
Determined not to give <PER>Snape</PER> an excuse to fail him  this lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> read and reread every line of the  instructions on the blackboard at least three times  before acting on them.
His Strengthening Solution  was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s but it was at least blue rather than pink,  like <PER>Neville</PER>’s, and he delivered a flask of it to <PER>Snape</PER>’s      desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled  defiance and relief.
“And the homework didn’t go too badly  either, did it?”   When neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> answered, she pressed  on, “I mean, all right, I didn’t expect the top grade,  not if he’s marking to O.W.L.
“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sharply, “if you want to know  what grades we got, ask.”   “I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me     “I got a P,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, ladling soup into his bowl.
“Charms.”   “What was it like?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> asked  together.
“Think of a dream, quick,” he told <PER>Ron</PER>, “in case the  old toad comes our way.”   “I did it last time,” <PER>Ron</PER> protested, “it’s your turn, you  tell me one.”   “Oh, I dunno ...” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, who could  not remember dreaming anything at all over the last  few days.
“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had  the dream, the number of letters in the subject ...  would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘cauldron’ or ‘<PER>Snape</PER>’?”   “It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  chancing a glance behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were not the only people watching and  listening sneakily from behind their books now; most  of the class were staring transfixed at Professor  Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height,  her beads and bangles clinking.
<PER>Harry</PER>  caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye and knew that <PER>Ron</PER> was thinking  exactly the same as he was: They both knew that  Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the  other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they  felt very much on Trelawney’s side — until she  swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened  in Divination while they all took out their copies of  Defensive Magical Theory, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could      ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called  them all to order and silence fell.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered  dully whether there were enough chapters in the book  to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons  and was on the point of checking the contents when  he noticed that <PER>Hermione</PER> had her hand in the air  again.
Instead of trying to pretend  she had not noticed <PER>Hermione</PER>, she got to her feet and  walked around the front row of desks until they were  face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so  that the rest of the class could not hear, “What is it  this time, Miss Granger?”   “I’ve already read chapter two,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Your previous teachers in this  subject may have allowed you more license, but as  none of them — with the possible exception of  Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have  restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects —  would have passed a Ministry inspection — ”   “Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  loudly, “there was just that minor drawback of him  having Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> sticking out of the back of his  head.”   This pronouncement was followed by one of the  loudest silences <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard.
Five points from Gryffindor!”   “But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in  detention again — ”   “What’s this, Potter?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  sharply, rounding on <PER>Harry</PER>.
From  whom?”   “From Professor Umbridge,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, not  meeting Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s beady, square-framed  eyes.
Angelina gave  <PER>Harry</PER> a look of deepest disgust and stalked away,  upon which <PER>Harry</PER> flung himself onto the bench  beside <PER>Ron</PER>, fuming.
How is that fair,  how?”   “I know, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sympathetically, tipping  bacon onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.”   <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, merely rustled the pages of her  Daily Prophet and said nothing.
“You think <PER>McGonagall</PER> was right, do you?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not speak to <PER>Hermione</PER> all through Charms,  but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his  anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were       sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the  memory of breakfast right out of his head.
Seamus handed back  <PER>Harry</PER>’s essay; <PER>Harry</PER> took it without looking at him  and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A.
So — you know the incantation, let  me see what you can do...”   “How she can lecture me about not losing my temper  with Umbridge!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER> under his voice,         but he was grinning; his anger with Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> had quite evaporated.
Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> around the class as she had followed  Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> would not permit it.
As they filed out of the classroom, <PER>Harry</PER> saw  Professor Umbridge approach the teacher’s desk; he  nudged <PER>Ron</PER>, who nudged <PER>Hermione</PER> in turn, and the  three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.
“Hurry up, you three,” she added, sweeping  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> before her.
“I am a substitute teacher standing in for  Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> exchanged uneasy looks with <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was whispering with Crabbe and  Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell  tales on <PER>Hagrid</PER> to a member of the Ministry.
“Hmm,” said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice,  though <PER>Harry</PER> could still hear her quite clearly, “I  wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant  to give me any information on the matter — can you  tell me what is causing Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s very  extended leave of absence?”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> look up eagerly.
Most people were able to answer  well and <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least the  class was not letting <PER>Hagrid</PER> down.
“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what  <PER>Hagrid</PER> told him to do,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> groaned.
He expected the common room to be empty when  he returned, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had sat up  waiting for him.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> would go nuts if she knew — ”   “Yeah, she probably would,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
You know, I was just saying to <PER>Ron</PER>  when you came in ... we’ve got to do something about  her.” "   “I suggested poison,” said <PER>Ron</PER> grimly.
“You know, I was  thinking today...” She shot a slightly nervous look at  <PER>Harry</PER> and then plunged on, “I was thinking that —  maybe the time’s come when we should just — just  do it ourselves.”   “Do what ourselves?” said <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously, still  floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles.
D’you realize <PER>Harry</PER> and I are behind on  homework again and it’s only the second week?”   “But this is much more important than homework!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> goggled at her.
“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was  suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W.
Then he turned to <PER>Ron</PER>, ready to  exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes  shared when <PER>Hermione</PER> elaborated on far-fetched  schemes like S.P.E.W.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s consternation,  however, <PER>Ron</PER> did not look exasperated.
“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against  the Dark Arts,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Look  what you’ve done\”   “How d’you mean?”   “You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this  stupid teaching me,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>, smirking  slightly.
first  year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.”   “But that was luck,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that wasn’t skill — ”   “Second year,” <PER>Ron</PER> interrupted, “you killed the  basilisk and destroyed Riddle.”   “Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I — ”         “Third year,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, louder still, “you fought off  about a hundred dementors at once — ”   “You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t  ??
“Last year,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, almost shouting now, “you  fought off You-Know-Who again — ”   “Listen to me!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, almost angrily, because  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were both smirking now.
It sounds great when you say it  like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn’t know  what I was doing half the time, I didn’t plan any of it,   I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly  always had help — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were still smirking and <PER>Harry</PER> felt  his temper rise; he wasn’t even sure why he was  feeling so angry.
Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s smiles had vanished.
The  whole time you know there’s nothing between you  and dying except your own — your own brain or guts  or whatever — like you can think straight when you  know you’re about a second from being murdered, or  tortured, or watching your friends die — they’ve never  taught us that in their classes, what it’s like to deal  with things like that — and you two sit there acting  like I’m a clever little boy to be standing here, alive,  like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just  don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it  would have been if <PER>Voldemort</PER> hadn’t needed me — ”   “We weren’t saying anything like that, mate,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, looking aghast.
This ... this  is exactly why we need you... We need to know what  it’s r-really like ... facing him ... facing V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   It was the first time she had ever said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  name, and it was this, more than anything else, that  calmed <PER>Harry</PER>.
IN THE HOG’S HEAD   <PER>Hermione</PER> made no mention of <PER>Harry</PER> giving Defense  Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks  after her original suggestion.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s detentions with  Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the  words now etched on the back of his hand would ever  fade entirely); <PER>Ron</PER> had had four more Quidditch  practices and not been shouted at during the last  two; and all three of them had managed to vanish  their mice in Transfiguration (<PER>Hermione</PER> had actually  progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject  was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at  the end of September, when the three of them were  sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for  <PER>Snape</PER>.
“I was wondering,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said suddenly, “whether  you’d thought any more about Defense Against the  Dark Arts, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “ ’Course I have,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grumpily.
“Can’t forget it,  can we, with that hag teaching us — ”        “I meant the idea <PER>Ron</PER> and I had” — <PER>Ron</PER> cast her an  alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him  — “oh, all right, the idea / had, then — about you  teaching us.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer at once.
Sometimes it  seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night  <PER>Hermione</PER> had proposed it, but at others, he had  found himself thinking about the spells that had  served him best in his various encounters with Dark  creatures and Death Eaters — found himself, in fact,  subconsciously planning lessons...   “Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to  find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer,  “yeah, I — I’ve thought about it a bit.”   “And?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> eagerly.
“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, who seemed keener to join in this conversation  now that he was sure that <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to  start shouting again.
“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being  luck, didn’t you?”   “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> gently, “but all the same,  there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at       Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are.
“He said  <PER>Harry</PER> knew how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he  was in the final year at Durmstrang.”   <PER>Ron</PER> was looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> suspiciously.
<PER>Hermione</PER> shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring  <PER>Ron</PER>, who was continuing to watch her, said to <PER>Harry</PER>,  “Well, what do you think?
Will you teach us?”   “Just you and <PER>Ron</PER>, yeah?”   “Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now looking a mite anxious  again.
I mean, we’re talking  about defending ourselves against V-<PER>Voldemort</PER> — oh,  don’t be pathetic, <PER>Ron</PER> — it doesn’t seem fair if we  don’t offer the chance to other people.”         <PER>Harry</PER> considered this for a moment, then said, “Yeah,  but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be  taught by me.
“Because,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, returning to the diagram of  the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, “I  don’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she  found out what we were up to.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward to the weekend trip  into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying  him.
What were  they going to do if the great black dog came bounding  up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps  under the nose of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and  about,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> discussed his fears  with him and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
And now he’s just shut up all the time  with that lunatic elf.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> scowled at <PER>Ron</PER>, but otherwise ignored the  slight on Kreacher.
“The trouble is,” she said to <PER>Harry</PER>, “until V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>  — oh for heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER> — comes out into the  open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn’t he?
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d go mad if he did  and Sirius listens to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> even if he doesn’t  like what he hears.”   When <PER>Harry</PER> continued to look worried, <PER>Hermione</PER>  said, “Listen, <PER>Ron</PER> and I have been sounding out  people who we thought might want to learn some  proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a  couple who seem interested.
“Don’t worry, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was even  further behind with his work than <PER>Harry</PER>, because  while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week,      <PER>Ron</PER> also had prefect duties.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great  sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something  from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, as he,  <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off at a brisk pace down the  wide drive to the gates.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very skeptically.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Hagrid</PER> mentioning this pub in his  first year: “Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s  Head,” he had said, explaining how he had won a  dragons egg from a hooded stranger there.
At the time  <PER>Harry</PER> had wondered why <PER>Hagrid</PER> had not found it odd  that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout  their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face  hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s Head.
“I don’t know about this, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered,  as they crossed to the bar.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated to the  farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking  around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages      rapped the counter with his knuckles and received  another smoking drink from the barman.
First came <PER>Neville</PER> with Dean and Lavender, who were  closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with  (<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of her  usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and  looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by  accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia  Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis  Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley,  Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait  down her back whose name <PER>Harry</PER> did not know;       three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called  Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot;  <PER>Ginny</PER>, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an  upturned nose whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized vaguely as  being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and  bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with  their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were  carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s  merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said <PER>Harry</PER> hoarsely to  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What are they expecting?”   “I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got  to say,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> soothingly; but <PER>Harry</PER>  continued to look at her so furiously that she added  quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak  to them first.”   “Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, beaming and taking a seat  opposite <PER>Harry</PER>.
Her friend, who had  curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave  <PER>Harry</PER> a thoroughly mistrustful look that told <PER>Harry</PER>  plainly that, given her way, she would not be here at  all.
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, some looking rather  excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing  dreamily into space.
Erm  ... well, <PER>Harry</PER> here had the idea — I mean” — <PER>Harry</PER>  had thrown her a sharp look — “I had the idea — that  it might be good if people who wanted to study  Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really  study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is  doing with us” — (<PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice became suddenly  much stronger and more confident) — “because  nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts”  — “Hear, hear,” said Anthony Goldstein, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> looked heartened — “well, I thought it  would be good if we, well, took matters into our own  hands.”   She paused, looked sideways at <PER>Harry</PER>, and went on,  “And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves  properly, not just theory but the real spells — ”   “You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts  O.W.L.
“Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes it — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“You mean, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes him,” said the blond  boy, nodding at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve  got the right to know exactly what makes him say  You-Know-Who’s back.”   “Look,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, intervening swiftly, “that’s  really not what this meeting was supposed to be  about — ”   “It’s okay, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told the whole school what  happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him, you  don’t believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon  trying to convince anyone.”   The whole group seemed to have held its breath while  <PER>Harry</PER> spoke.
He didn’t give us details, he didn’t tell us  exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we’d all  like to know — ”   “If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when  <PER>Voldemort</PER> murders someone I can’t help you,” <PER>Harry</PER>  said.
“I  never knew that!”   “Mum told <PER>Ron</PER> not to spread it around,” said Fred,  grinning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And in our first year,” said <PER>Neville</PER> to the group at  large, “he saved that Sorcerous Stone — ”       “Sorcerer’s,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Here’s an idea,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, before <PER>Harry</PER> could  speak, “why don’t you shut your mouth?”   Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected <PER>Ron</PER>  particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking  at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better  than to thump him.
“Yes, well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, “moving on ... the  point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   There was a murmur of general agreement.
“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, slightly impatiently, “but you know,  this is rather important, we’re talking about learning  to defend ourselves against V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Death  Eaters — ”   “Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had  been expecting to speak long before this.
Obviously they are in denial  about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a  teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from  using defensive spells — ”   “We think the reason Umbridge doesn’t want us  trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, “is that she’s got some ... some mad idea  that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could use the students in the school  as a kind of private army.
“Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the  ground burning everything in front of — ”   “They don’t exist, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tartly.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>McGonagall</PER> might let us have hers,  she did when <PER>Harry</PER> was practicing for the  Tri wizard...”   But <PER>Harry</PER> was pretty certain that <PER>McGonagall</PER> would  not be so accommodating this time.
“Well, I think that went quite well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  happily, as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> walked out of the  Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments  later, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> still clutching their bottles of  butterbeer.
But the more people  the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his  friends wouldn’t have come if he hadn’t been going  out with <PER>Ginny</PER> — ”   <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been draining the last few drops from  his butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer  down his front.
“She’s going out with —         my sister’s going — what d’you mean, Michael  Corner?”   “Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think —  well, they’re obviously interested in learning defense,  but if <PER>Ginny</PER> hadn’t told Michael what was going on —     “When did this — when did she — ?”   “They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at  the end of last year,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> composedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed  her.
“But,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, following <PER>Hermione</PER> along a row of  quills in copper pots, “I thought <PER>Ginny</PER> fancied <PER>Harry</PER>!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at him rather pityingly and shook  her head.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> used to fancy <PER>Harry</PER>, but she gave up on him  months ago.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whose head was still full of Cho’s parting wave,  did not find this subject quite as interesting as <PER>Ron</PER>,  who was positively quivering with indignation, but it  did bring something home to him that until now he  had not really registered.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his  feet, “this is exactly why <PER>Ginny</PER> hasn’t told you she’s  seeing Michael, she knew you’d take it badly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> rolled her eyes at  <PER>Harry</PER> and then said in an undertone, while <PER>Ron</PER> was  muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, “And  talking about Michael and <PER>Ginny</PER> .
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, smiling slightly, “she just  couldn’t keep her eyes off you, could she?”       <PER>Harry</PER> had never before appreciated just how beautiful  the village of Hogsmeade was.
Signed:   Dolores Jane Umbridge  HIGH INQUISITOR   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> read the notice over the heads of some  anxious-looking second years.
“Or — I thought that Michael Corner  had a really shifty look too — ”   “I wonder if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s seen this yet?” <PER>Harry</PER> said,  looking around at the door to the girls’ dormitories.
There was a brief moment when <PER>Ron</PER> tried to keep  running, arms working madly like windmills, then he  toppled over backward and shot down the newly  created slide, coming to rest on his back at <PER>Harry</PER>’s  feet.
“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’  dormitories,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Ron</PER> to his feet and  trying not to laugh.
“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled  happily, leaping to their feet and ogling <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s allowed in our  dormitory, how come we’re not allowed — ?”   “Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and  was now getting to her feet, “but it says in Hogwarts,  A History that the founders thought boys were less  trustworthy than girls.
“You’re so naive,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you think just because  you’re all honorable and trustworthy — ”         “No, they can’t have done because I put a jinx on that  piece of parchment we all signed,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  grimly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> had barely taken their seats when  <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> descended  upon them.
“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically  at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not  even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he  doodled idly on his parchment ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly  painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned in closer;  <PER>Hermione</PER> even put down her quill.
His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would  have been <PER>Hagrid</PER>, of course, but as he had no idea  where <PER>Hagrid</PER> was, his only remaining option was to  find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would  help.
As  <PER>Harry</PER> approached, one of them croaked, “You should  be in class, sunny Jim.”   “This is urgent,” said <PER>Harry</PER> curtly.
“Well, that’s put us in our place,  hasn’t it?”         <PER>Harry</PER> knocked; he heard footsteps and then the door  opened and he found himself face-to-face with  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It’s my owl, she’s injured.”   “Injured owl, did you say?”   Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a  copy of the Daily Prophet   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lifting Hedwig carefully off his  shoulder, “she turned up after the other post owls  and her wing’s all funny, look — ”   Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly  between her teeth and took Hedwig from <PER>Harry</PER> while  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> watched.
Can’t think what would  have done it, though... Thestrals will sometimes go for  birds, of course, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s got the Hogwarts  thestrals well trained not to touch owls ...”         <PER>Harry</PER> neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he  just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all  right.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, however, looked sharply  at <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “Do you know how far this owl’s  traveled, Potter?”   “Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> gave him a curt nod and retreated into  the staffroom, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to be swept out into the  courtyard with the crowd.
Here he spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> already standing in a sheltered corner,  their cloak collars turned up against the wind.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>  and back again.
I mean, she’s never  been hurt on a flight before, has she?”       “Who’s the letter from anyway?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, taking  the note from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It  wouldn’t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by  magic... And if anyone’s watching the Floo Network ...  but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to  come without that being intercepted too!”   They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons  for Potions, all three of them lost in thought, but as  they reached the bottom of the stairs they were  recalled to themselves by the voice of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  who was standing just outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s classroom  door, waving around an official-looking piece of  parchment and talking much louder than was  necessary so that they could hear every word.
Well, it was pretty  much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really  well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry...         It’ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are  allowed to keep playing, wont it?”   “Don’t rise,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered imploringly to <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER>, who were both watching <PER>Malfoy</PER>, faces set  and fists clenched.
“It’s what he wants...”   “I mean,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, raising his voice a little more,  his gray eyes glittering malevolently in <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s direction, “if it’s a question of influence with the  Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance...   From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an  excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years... And as for  Potter ... My father says it’s a matter of time before  the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo’s...  apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose  brains have been addled by magic...”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging  open and his eyes rolling.
A split second later he  realized that <PER>Neville</PER> had just charged past him,  heading straight for <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, no!”   <PER>Harry</PER> leapt forward and seized the back of <PER>Neville</PER>’s  robes; <PER>Neville</PER> struggled frantically, his fists flailing,  trying desperately to get at <PER>Malfoy</PER> who looked, for a  moment, extremely shocked.
“Help me!” <PER>Harry</PER> flung at <PER>Ron</PER>, managing to get an  arm around <PER>Neville</PER>’s neck and dragging him  backward, away from the Slytherins.
<PER>Ron</PER> hurried forward and  seized <PER>Neville</PER>’s arms; together, he and <PER>Harry</PER>  succeeded in dragging <PER>Neville</PER> back into the Gryffindor  line.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s face was scarlet; the pressure <PER>Harry</PER> was  exerting on his throat rendered him quite  incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his  mouth.
His  black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point  where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were wrestling with <PER>Neville</PER>.
Inside, all of you.”   <PER>Harry</PER> let go of <PER>Neville</PER>, who stood panting and glaring  at him.
“What in the name of Merlin,” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly, as  they followed <PER>Neville</PER>, “was that about?”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer.
He knew exactly why the  subject of people who were in St. Mungo’s because of  magical damage to their brains was highly distressing  to <PER>Neville</PER>, but he had sworn to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that he  would not tell anyone <PER>Neville</PER>’s secret.
Even <PER>Neville</PER> did  not know that <PER>Harry</PER> knew.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took their usual seats at  the back of the class and pulled out parchment,  quills, and their copies of One Thousand Magical  Herbs and Fungi.
The class around them was  whispering about what <PER>Neville</PER> had just done, but  when <PER>Snape</PER> closed the dungeon door with an echoing  bang everybody fell silent immediately.
“You will notice,” said <PER>Snape</PER> in his low, sneering  voice, “that we have a guest with us today.”   He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon,  and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor Umbridge sitting there,  clipboard on her knee.
He glanced sideways at <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, his eyebrows raised.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very  interested in hearing her question <PER>Snape</PER>, so  interested, that he was becoming careless with his  potion again.
“Salamander blood, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned,  grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong  ingredient for the third time.
His eyes on <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> added a few  drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned  from turquoise to orange.
<PER>Snape</PER>  looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and their eyes met for a  second.
“No marks again, then, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>  maliciously, emptying <PER>Harry</PER>’s cauldron with a wave of  his wand.
“I’ll pretend to be ill and do <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay  instead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night...”   “You can’t skive off Divination,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  severely.
But <PER>Harry</PER>’s already missed History of Magic  and I don’t think he ought to miss anything else  today!”   There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an  hour later <PER>Harry</PER> took his seat in the hot, over-  perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom  feeling angry at everybody.
Professor  Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the  table between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and swept away, her  lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at  Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head,  and thrust the final one into <PER>Neville</PER>’s chest with such  force that he slipped off his pouf.
"... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on  probation ... we shall see ... how she dares ...”   “You and Umbridge have got something in common,”  <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly when they met again in  Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical  Theory and read the third chapter, entitled The Case  for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack.’ There  will be — ”   “ — no need to talk,” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> said  together under their breaths.
“No Quidditch practice,” said Angelina in hollow tones  when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the common  room that night after dinner.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “look on the bright side — at  least now you’ll have time to do <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay!”   “That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER>  stared incredulously at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Lee  Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was  lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the  same Vanishing Spell <PER>Snape</PER> kept using on <PER>Harry</PER>’s  potions.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was not helping matters; the  cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred  and George’s bucket were punctuated by loud and  disapproving sniffs that <PER>Harry</PER> found, if anything,  more distracting.
“They’re quite  within their rights to eat the foul things themselves,  and I can’t find a rule that says the other idiots aren’t  entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be         dangerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though  they are...”   She, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> watched George projectile-vomit  into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and  straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to  protracted applause.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, they’ve got about twenty-six Galleons  already...”   It was a long while before the crowd around the  Weasleys dispersed, and then Fred, Lee, and George  sat up counting their takings even longer, so that it  was well past midnight when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> finally had the common room to themselves  again.
As  he put his books away, <PER>Ron</PER>, who was dozing lightly in  an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked  blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!”   <PER>Harry</PER> whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was  sitting in the fire again.
“Hi,” chorused <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, all three  kneeling down upon the hearthrug.
“Not that good,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled  Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers.
“You’ve got a lot to learn, <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   “Who overheard us?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded.
Anyway ... First of all, <PER>Ron</PER> —  I’ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.”   “Oh yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding apprehensive.
She also” — Sirius’s eyes turned to the other two  — “advises <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> not to proceed with  the group, though she accepts that she has no  authority over either of them and simply begs them to  remember that she has their best interests at heart.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, this whole thing was your idea!” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at her.
“Hear, hear,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically.
“Hey, that’s an idea!” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> made a skeptical noise and all three of  them looked at her, Sirius’s head turning in the  flames.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped at the flames for a  moment, then turned to look at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Today, with the room full of  croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a  heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding  against the classroom windows, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s whispered discussion about how     Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite  unnoticed.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  you’re squashing your frog.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked down; he was indeed squeezing his  bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced  it hastily upon the desk.
“Silenciol” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, pointing her wand  at <PER>Harry</PER>’s frog, which deflated silently before them.
“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, watching <PER>Ron</PER> critically.
“Fine, let’s swap,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, seizing <PER>Ron</PER>’s raven  and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog.
“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s  squeaky little voice and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> all  jumped.
It came as no surprise to any of them that <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> were given additional practice of the Silencing  Charm for homework.
“To re-form the  Quidditch team!”   “Excellent.” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“I went to  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and I think she might have appealed to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — anyway, Umbridge had to give in.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
“I was just wondering,” she said, her voice stronger  now, “whether we’re doing the right thing, starting  this Defense Against the Dark Arts group.”   “What!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, it was your idea in the first place!” said  <PER>Ron</PER> indignantly.
“Let’s get this straight,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, as they  put their bags back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with  us, so you don’t think we should do it anymore?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked tense and rather miserable.
<PER>Hermione</PER> watched Katie leap to  her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a  few moments before <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke again and it  sounded as though she was choosing her words very  carefully.
The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so  that at seven o’clock that evening, when <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice,  they were soaked through within minutes, their feet  slipping and sliding on the sodden grass.
<PER>Harry</PER>, didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop  the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff  in that storm?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER> did it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But ...” Looking scared, <PER>Ron</PER> strode across to the  window and stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t  be near us now, can he?”   “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, sinking onto a bench and  rubbing his forehead.
He felt <PER>Ron</PER> sit down on  the bench beside him and knew <PER>Ron</PER> was staring at  him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re  reading You-Know-Who’s mind...”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking his head.
“Umbridge is  watching the owls and the fires, remember?”   “Well then, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ”   “I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg,  and swinging it around himself.
“There’s no point  telling him again.”   <PER>Ron</PER> did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching  <PER>Harry</PER> thoughtfully.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice and <PER>Harry</PER>  came back to his senses just in time to clamber  through the portrait hole into the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was rather grateful that she  was not around because he did not much want to  discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go  to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too.
<PER>Ron</PER> kept throwing him anxious  glances, but <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out his Potions book and      set to work to finish his essay, though he was only  pretending to concentrate and, by the time that <PER>Ron</PER>  said he was going to bed too, had written hardly  anything.
have you been taking all the clothes  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been leaving out?”   “Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been  taking some for Winky too, sir.”   “Yeah, how is Winky?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> Potter  does not seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening  up again and looking timidly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Was <PER>Harry</PER> Potter having  bad dreams?”   “Not really bad,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, yawning and rubbing his  eyes.
Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping,   “Dobby wishes he could help <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, for <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much  happier now...”   <PER>Harry</PER> smiled.
He has hidden her in the Room of  Requirement and he has found antidotes to  butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her  on while she sleeps it off, sir... And Dobby knows Mr.  Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when  he has run short, sir, and — ”   “ — and if you really needed a bathroom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  suddenly remembering something <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, “would  it fill itself with chamber pots?”   “Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding  earnestly.
When can you show me where  it is?”     “Anytime, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking  delighted at <PER>Harry</PER>’s enthusiasm.
“We could go now, if  you like!”   For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was tempted to go now; he was  halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs  for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a  voice very much like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s whispered in his ear:  reckless.
Don’t you remember when he lost you all the  bones in your arm?”   “This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s;  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knows about it too, he mentioned it to  me at the Yule Ball.”   <PER>Hermione</PER>’s expression cleared.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you about it?”   “Just in passing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
Somewhat to <PER>Harry</PER>’s  disappointment, it was <PER>Ginny</PER> who managed to find  Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end  of dinner he was confident that the news had been  passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had  turned up in the Hog’s Head.
At half-past seven <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the  Gryffindor common room, <PER>Harry</PER> clutching a certain  piece of aged parchment in his hand.
“Filch is on the second floor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, holding the  map close to his eyes and scanning it closely, “and  Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.”   “And Umbridge?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously.
<PER>Ron</PER> had screwed up his eyes in       concentration, <PER>Hermione</PER> was whispering something  under her breath, <PER>Harry</PER>’s fists were clenched as he  stared ahead of him.
Just give us a place to practice ... somewhere they  can’t find us ...   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, as they wheeled  around after their third walk past.
The  Dark Arts Outsmarted ... Self-Defensive Spellwork ...  wow ...” She looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, her face  glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of  books had finally convinced <PER>Hermione</PER> that what they         were doing was right.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked  around; <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean  had arrived.
“What, <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “I think we ought to elect a leader,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s leader,” said Cho at once, looking at  <PER>Hermione</PER> as though she were mad, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s  stomach did yet another back flip.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too quick for <PER>Neville</PER>, whose wand  went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a  shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of  a bookshelf, from which <PER>Harry</PER> retrieved it with a  Summoning Charm.
“Expelliarmusl” said <PER>Neville</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, caught  unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.
“I’ve never done it  before — I DID IT!”     “Good one!” said <PER>Harry</PER> encouragingly, deciding not to  point out that in a real duel situation <PER>Neville</PER>’s  opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite  direction with his wand held loosely at his side.
“Listen, <PER>Neville</PER>, can you take it in turns to practice  with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for a couple of minutes so I  can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”   <PER>Harry</PER> moved off into the middle of the room.
“Sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said George hastily, when <PER>Harry</PER>  caught his eye.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> called from the other end of  the room, “have you checked the time?”   He looked down at his watch and received a shock —  it was already ten past nine, which meant they  needed to get back to their common rooms  immediately or risk being caught and punished by  Filch for being out-of-bounds.
“That was really, really good, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  when finally it was just her, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> left.
“Did you see me disarm  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Only once,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, stung.
were resisting her under her  very nose, doing the very thing that she and the  Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed  to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during her  lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of  their most recent meetings, remembering how <PER>Neville</PER>  had successfully disarmed <PER>Hermione</PER>, how Colin  Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after  three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had  produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had  reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to  dust.
We take one each, and  when <PER>Harry</PER> sets the date of the next meeting he’ll  change the numbers on his coin, and because I’ve put  a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic  his.”   A blank silence greeted <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s words.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked  sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> touches one of  them, and all their scars burn, and they know they’ve  got to join him.”   “Well ... yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized how much  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> cared about beating Slytherin  when she abstained from giving them homework in  the week leading up to the match.
Nobody could quite believe  their ears until she looked directly at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing  the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really  don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,  so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?”   <PER>Snape</PER> was no less obviously partisan: He had booked  the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often  that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to  play.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they  had, after all, never lost to <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s team.
On the other hand, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Ron</PER> make  some truly spectacular saves when he was on form:  During one memorable practice, he had hung one-  handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so  hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the  length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the  other end.
Even Fred had said  that <PER>Ron</PER> might yet make him and George proud, and  that they were seriously considering admitting that he  was related to them, something he assured <PER>Ron</PER> they  had been trying to deny for four years.
The only thing really worrying <PER>Harry</PER> was how much  <PER>Ron</PER> was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to  upset him before they even got onto the pitch.
“Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be  more worried if he was aiming for the person next to  me,” he retorted, which made <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face.
When <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> imitated <PER>Ron</PER>  dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they  were within sight of each other), <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears glowed  red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely  to drop whatever he was holding at the time too.
When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke he looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed  and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his  knees, staring fixedly into space.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded  forcibly of the time that <PER>Ron</PER> had accidentally put a  slug- vomiting charm on himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to see what was written on  the badges as he walked by, but he was too  concerned to get <PER>Ron</PER> past their table quickly to linger  long enough to read them.
“Look at that save  you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and  George said it was brilliant — ”       <PER>Ron</PER> turned a tortured face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I  didn’t mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when  none of you were looking and I was trying to get back  on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.”   “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, recovering quickly from this  unpleasant surprise, “a few more accidents like that  and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> sat down opposite them wearing  red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes.
“How’re you feeling?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now  staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his  empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering  attempting to drown himself in them.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s  just got to have some breakfast.”   It became clear after ten minutes, however, that <PER>Ron</PER>  was not capable of eating anything more and <PER>Harry</PER>  thought it best to get him down to the changing  rooms.
As they rose from the table, <PER>Hermione</PER> got up  too, and taking <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, she drew him to one  side.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked questioningly at her, but she shook her  head warningly; <PER>Ron</PER> had just ambled over to them,  looking lost and desperate.
“Good luck, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, standing on tiptoe  and kissing him on the cheek.
“And you, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to come to himself slightly as they  walked back across the Great Hall.
He seemed too distracted to  notice much around him, but <PER>Harry</PER> cast a curious  glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed  the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the  words etched onto them:   WEASLEY   IS OUR KING   With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean  nothing good, he hurried <PER>Ron</PER> across the entrance  hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed out these encouraging factors to  <PER>Ron</PER> as they walked, but he was not sure that <PER>Ron</PER>  was listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  pulled on their robes (<PER>Ron</PER> attempted to do his up  back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took  pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to  listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices  outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came  pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.
They’re two         blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t know much  about them — ”   “We do,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot  upward; out of the corner of his eye <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER>  streak off toward the goal hoops.
He zoomed higher,  dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the  pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other  side of the stadium, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing exactly  the same.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help himself: Abandoning his search  for the Snitch, he turned his Firebolt toward <PER>Ron</PER>, a  lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before  the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington  pelted toward him ...   “ — and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington  heading for goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just  the Keeper ahead — ”   A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands  below:   Weasley cannot save a thing,   He cannot block a single ring .
“ — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper,  Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a  promising new talent on the team — come on, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin  end: <PER>Ron</PER> had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the  Quaffle had soared between them, straight through  <PER>Ron</PER>’s central hoop.
There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked;  <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still circling the stadium just like <PER>Harry</PER>.
They passed midway around the pitch going in  opposite directions and <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Malfoy</PER> singing  loudly,   WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN .
“ — and it’s Warrington again,” bellowed Lee, “who  passes to Pucey, Pucey’s off past Spinnet, come on  now Angelina, you can take him — turns out you  can’t — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean,  George Weasley, oh who cares, one of them anyway,  and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — er  — drops it too — so that’s Montague with the Quaffle,  Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle, and  he’s off up the pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block  him!”   <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed around the end of the stadium behind  the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not to look at       what was going on at <PER>Ron</PER>’s end; as he sped past the  Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing along  with the crowd below,   WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING .
“ — and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading  straight for goal, stop it, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not have to look to see what had happened:  There was a terrible groan from the Gryffindor end,  coupled with fresh screams and applause from the  Slytherins.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had  sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his  frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping  one eye on <PER>Malfoy</PER> in case he showed signs of having  spotted it, but <PER>Malfoy</PER>, like him, was continuing to  soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly .
In a matter of seconds, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was streaking out of  the sky on <PER>Harry</PER>’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying  flat on his broom...
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled his Firebolt around, he and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were  now neck and neck .
Feet from the ground, <PER>Harry</PER> lifted his right hand from  his broom, stretching toward the Snitch ... to his  right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm extended too, reaching, groping ...
It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept  seconds — <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers closed around the tiny,  struggling ball — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s fingernails scrabbled the  back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand hopelessly — <PER>Harry</PER> pulled his  broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his  hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their  approval...
They were saved, it did not matter that <PER>Ron</PER> had let in  those goals, nobody would remember as long as  Gryffindor had won —   WHAM   A Bludger hit <PER>Harry</PER> squarely in the small of the back  and he flew forward off his broom; luckily he was only  five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low  to catch the Snitch, but he was winded all the same  as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch.
“He  whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you’d  got the Snitch — but we won, <PER>Harry</PER>, we won!”         <PER>Harry</PER> heard a snort from behind him and turned  around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand:  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had landed close by; white-faced with  fury, he was still managing to sneer.
“I’ve never seen a worse Keeper ... but then he  was born in a bin... Did you like my lyrics, Potter?”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; he turned away to meet the  rest of the team who were now landing one by one,  yelling and punching the air in triumph, all except  <PER>Ron</PER>, who had dismounted from his broom over by the  goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the  changing rooms alone.
“We wanted to write another couple of verses!” <PER>Malfoy</PER>  called, as Katie and Alicia hugged <PER>Harry</PER>.
Halfway through shaking <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand they  stiffened, looking around at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Can’t see how you stand the         stink, but I suppose when you’ve been dragged up by  Muggles even the Weasleys’ hovel smells okay — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed hold of George; meanwhile it was  taking the combined efforts of Angelina, Alicia, and  Katie to stop Fred leaping on <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was  laughing openly.
“Or perhaps,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, leering as he backed away,  “you can remember what your mother’s house stank  like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> was not aware of releasing George, all he knew  was that a second later both of them were sprinting at  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
With no time  to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist  clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could  into <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s stomach —   “<PER>Harry</PER>!
1VO!”   He could hear girls’ voices screaming, <PER>Malfoy</PER> yelling,  George swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing  of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not  until somebody in the vicinity yelled “ IMPEDIMENTA !”  and only when he was knocked over backward by the  force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to  punch every inch of <PER>Malfoy</PER> he could reach...   “What do you think you’re doing?” screamed Madam  Hooch, as <PER>Harry</PER> leapt to his feet again; it was she  who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware that something was  still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of  which he had bruised against <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s jaw; looking  down he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding  from between his fingers, struggling for release.
Explain yourselves!”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> provoked us,” said <PER>Harry</PER> stiffly.
“And  <PER>Harry</PER>’s mother.”   “But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out,  you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle  dueling, did you?” bellowed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra  authority.”   <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been surprised to see sparks fly  from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s nostrils.
But I am not  unreasonable, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” she continued,  turning back to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> who was now  standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at  her.
Everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked there were disconsolate  and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped  around the fire, all apart from <PER>Ron</PER>, who had not been  seen since the end of the match.
Has she banned him?”   “No,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> miserably; she and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  sitting on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Only <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were left beside the  fire.
“Have you seen <PER>Ron</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked in a low voice.
When he saw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> he stopped  dead in his tracks.
“Come and sit  down!”   <PER>Ron</PER> walked to the fireside and sank into the chair  farthest from <PER>Harry</PER>’s, not looking at him.
“I’m  going to resign first thing tomorrow.”   “If you resign,” said <PER>Harry</PER> testily, “there’ll only be  three players left on the team.” And when <PER>Ron</PER> looked  puzzled, he said, “I’ve been given a lifetime ban.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told him the full story; <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear  to tell it again.
“This is all my fault — ”   “You didn’t make me punch <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  angrily.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s back.”          HAGRID’S TALE   <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted up to the boys’ dormitory to fetch the  Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from his  trunk; he was so quick that he and <PER>Ron</PER> were ready to  leave at least five minutes before <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried  back down from the girls’ dormitories, wearing scarf,  gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats.
With a great leap of his heart, <PER>Harry</PER> saw little golden  squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from      <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chimney.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s us!” <PER>Harry</PER> called through the keyhole.
Well, get in, get in!”   “I’m sorry!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, as the three of them  squeezed past <PER>Hagrid</PER> into the house and pulled the  cloak off themselves so he could see them.
“I just —  oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>).”   “It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hastily,  shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close  all the curtains, but <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to gaze up  at him in horror.
“Want a  cuppa?”   “Come off it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you’re in a right state!”   “I’m tellin’yeh, I’m fine,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, straightening  up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing.
“Blimey, it’s good ter see you three again — had good  summers, did yeh?”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you’ve been attacked!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously.
“You’re not going to eat that, are you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, leaning in for a closer look.
More’n me job’s worth ter  tell yeh that.”   “Did the giants beat you up, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>  quietly.
“Come on, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, tell us what you’ve been up to!”  said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Tell us about being attacked by the giants  and <PER>Harry</PER> can tell you about being attacked by the  dementors — ”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> choked in his mug and dropped his steak at  the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and  dragon blood was sprayed over the table as <PER>Hagrid</PER>  coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft  splat, onto the floor.
“Oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, don’t, it’s not hygien — ” <PER>Hermione</PER>  began, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> had already slapped the meat back  over his swollen eye.
“You  knew where the giants were?”   “Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew, an’ he told us,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“But  — why couldn’t you just grab a Portkey or  something?”   There was an odd expression in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unobscured  eye as he squinted at <PER>Ron</PER>; it was almost pitying.
“The Ministry’s  keepin’ an eye on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> an’ anyone they  reckon’s in league with him, an’ — ”   “We know about that,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, keen to  hear the rest of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s story.
“We know about the  Ministry watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ”   “So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>,  looking thunderstruck.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> says it’s our fault, it was the  wizards who forced ’em to go an’ made ’em live a good  long way from us an’ they had no choice but ter stick  together fer their own protection.”   “So,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “you saw them and then what?”   “Well, we waited till morning, didn’ want ter go  sneakin’ up on ’em in the dark, fer our own safety,”  said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“You  just walked right into a giant camp?”   “Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d told us how ter do it,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“It was def’nitely on some of their minds,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, shrugging, “but we did what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told  us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an’       keep our eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others.
Anyway, that firs’  day we gave him a branch o’ Gubraithian fire.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> said “wow” softly, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both  frowned in puzzlement.
“A branch of — ?”   “Everlasting fire,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably, “you ought  to know that by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it  at least twice in class!”   “Well anyway,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quickly, intervening before  <PER>Ron</PER> could answer back, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d bewitched  this branch to burn evermore, which isn’ somethin’  any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down in the snow  by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the  giants from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who sends his  respectful greetings.’ ”   “And what did Karkus say?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“Didn’ speak English.”   “You’re kidding!”   “Didn’ matter,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> imperturbably,  “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had warned us tha’ migh’ happen.
So then I said, Altars <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asks the  Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns  tomorrow with another gift.’ ”   “Why couldn’t you speak to them that day?” asked  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted us ter take it very slow,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
We had ter leg it an’ we knew  there was no way we was going ter be able ter march  inter camp again.”   “Blimey, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly.
“Well that’s not bad  — are they going to come over here and start fighting  You-Know-Who with us?”   But <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’  <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked at her sadly.
“Nope,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, heaving a deep sigh as he turned  over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his  face, “but we did wha’ we meant ter do, we gave ’em  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s message an’ some o’ them heard it an’ I  ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it.
<PER>Harry</PER> became  aware that the knees of his robes were soaked  through; Fang was drooling with his head in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  lap.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly after a while.
mother while you were  there?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unobscured eye rested upon her, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather scared.
<PER>Hermione</PER> glanced nervously  at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, plainly wanting them to speak.
“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this  state, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, gesturing toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  bloodstained face.
“Get under here!” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly; seizing the  Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and  <PER>Hermione</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> tore around the table and dived  beneath the cloak as well.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, hide our mugs!”       <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s mugs and shoved  them under the cushion in Fang’s basket.
Twice they stared  directly into the corner where <PER>Harry</PER> stood,  sandwiched between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, with a most unhelpful glance  toward the corner where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  stood hidden, “oh, tha’ was ... was Fang.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped; <PER>Harry</PER> clapped a hand over her  mouth.
I don’ know why that’d be...” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing  toward the corner where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  stood, as though asking for help.
She passed within two inches of where  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood pressed against the  wall; <PER>Harry</PER> actually pulled in his stomach as she  walked by.
How did you sustain those injuries?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> hastily removed the dragon steak from his  face, which in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion was a mistake, because  the black-and-purple bruising all around his eye was  now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount  of fresh and congealed blood on his face.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but  <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his wrist.
“Trelawney’s  on probation already...”   “Um ... what sort of thing are you planning to do with  us in class, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I don’ want ter  spoil the surprise.”   “Look, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> urgently, dropping all  pretense, “Professor Umbridge won’t be at all happy if  you bring anything to class that’s too dangerous — ”   “Dangerous?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking genially bemused.
I  mean, all righ’, they can look after themselves — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you’ve got to pass Umbridge’s inspection,  and to do that it would really be better if she saw you       teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the  difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like  that!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“But tha’s not very interestin’, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“The stuff I’ve got’s much more impressive,   I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I reckon I’ve got the  on’y domestic herd in Britain — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER> ... please ...” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, a note of real  desperation in her voice.
Please, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, teach us something  dull that’s bound to come up in our O.W.L...”   But <PER>Hagrid</PER> merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed  look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner.
“Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise  yeh I’ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons  now I’m back... Now you lot had better get back up to  the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe yer footprints out  behind yeh!”   “I dunno if you got through to him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> a short  while later when, having checked that the coast was  clear, they walked back up to the castle through the  thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to  the Obliteration Charm <PER>Hermione</PER> was performing as  they went.
I don’t care if she throws out Trelawney but she’s not  taking <PER>Hagrid</PER>!”         THE EYE OF THE SNAKE   <PER>Hermione</PER> plowed her way back to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin  through two feet of snow on Sunday morning.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> wanted to go with her, but their mountain of  homework had reached an alarming height again, so  they grudgingly remained in the common room, trying  to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the  grounds outside, where students were enjoying  themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing,  and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to  Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.
“Gits ...”        <PER>Hermione</PER> returned from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just before lunch,  shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees.
He kept saying  nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls  than chimaeras — oh I don’t think he’s got a  chimaera,” she added at the appalled look on <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER>’s faces, “but that’s not for lack of trying from  what he said about how hard it is to get eggs...
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> headed down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold.
<PER>Harry</PER>  was worried, not only about what <PER>Hagrid</PER> might have  decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of  the class, particularly <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his cronies, would  behave if Umbridge was watching them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand  this: Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> perhaps been attacked by some  creature whose venom prevented the wounds it  inflicted from healing?
Anyway, they prefer the dark...”   “What prefers the dark?” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Malfoy</PER> say  sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his  voice.
“What did he say prefers the dark — did you  hear?”       <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the only occasion on which <PER>Malfoy</PER>  had entered the forest before now; he had not been  very brave then either.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who sighed but nodded, and the  three of them set off after <PER>Hagrid</PER>, leading the rest of  the class.
And then, as <PER>Hagrid</PER>  shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his  enormous chest, <PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER> and pointed into  the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
He       looked eagerly at <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was still staring  around into the trees and after a few seconds he  whispered, “Why doesn’t <PER>Hagrid</PER> call again?”   Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions  as confused and nervously expectant as <PER>Ron</PER>’s and  were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing  feet from them.
An’ — ”   “Excuse me,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in a sneering voice, “but  what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?”   For answer, <PER>Hagrid</PER> pointed at the cow carcass on the  ground.
“What’s  eating it?”   “Thestrals,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly and <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a  soft “oh!” of comprehension at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
’Course, this lot don’ get a lot o’  work, it’s mainly jus’ pullin’ the school carriages  unless <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s takin’ a long journey an’ don’  want ter Apparate — an’ here’s another couple, look     Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of  them passing very close to Parvati, who shivered and  pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, “I think I felt  something, I think it’s near me!”   “Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> patiently.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked as though  Christmas had come a month early; <PER>Hermione</PER>, on the  other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
This  one,” he patted the first horse to have appeared,   “name o’ Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, firs’ one  born here in the forest — ”   “Are you aware,” Umbridge said loudly, interrupting  him, “that the Ministry of Magic has classified  thestrals as ‘dangerous’?”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank like a stone, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> merely  chuckled.
Well, there’s loads o’ good stuff abou’ them...”   “Do you find,” said Professor Umbridge in a ringing  voice to Pansy Parkinson, “that you are able to  understand Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER> when he talks?”   Just like <PER>Hermione</PER>, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but  these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was  almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress  her giggles.
“Erm,” said <PER>Neville</PER> nervously, with a glance at <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“No!” said <PER>Neville</PER>, looking upset, “no, I’m not scared of  them — !”   “It’s quite all right,” said Umbridge, patting <PER>Neville</PER> on  the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be  an understanding smile, though it looked more like a  leer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she turned to look up at  him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow      voice, “I think I’ve got enough to be getting along  with... You will receive” — she mimed taking  something from the air in front of her — “the results  of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard —  “in ten days’ time.” She held up ten stubby little  fingers, then, her smile wider and more toadlike than  ever before beneath her green hat, she bustled from  their midst, leaving <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Pansy Parkinson in  fits of laughter, <PER>Hermione</PER> actually shaking with fury,  and <PER>Neville</PER> looking confused and upset.
It’s her thing about half-breeds all over again — she’s  trying to make out <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s some kind of dim-witted  troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother —  and oh, it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad lesson at  all — I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended  Skrewts again, but thestrals are fine — in fact, for  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, they’re really good!”   “Umbridge said they’re dangerous,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, it’s like <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, they can look after  themselves,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, “and I  suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn’t  usually show them to us before N.E.W.T.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER> — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that  was a really stupid thing to say — ”       “It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry...”     “I’m surprised so many people could see them,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s prefect duties also became more  and more onerous as Christmas approached.
They  were called upon to supervise the decoration of the  castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got  the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>), to watch over first and second years  spending their break times inside because of the  bitter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you  know, we definitely weren’t that rude when we were in  first year,” said <PER>Ron</PER>), and to patrol the corridors in  shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the  holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of  wizard duels (“He’s got dung for brains, that one,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously).
<PER>Hermione</PER> was  going skiing with her parents, something that greatly  amused <PER>Ron</PER>, who had never before heard of Muggles  strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide  down mountains.
<PER>Harry</PER> endured several days of jealousy  before <PER>Ron</PER> said, in response to <PER>Harry</PER> asking how <PER>Ron</PER>  was going to get home for Christmas, “But you’re  coming too!
Mum wrote and told me to  invite you weeks ago!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> rolled her eyes, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits soared:  The thought of Christmas at the Burrow was truly  wonderful, only slightly marred by <PER>Harry</PER>’s guilty  feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday  with Sirius.
Sirius had not contacted <PER>Harry</PER> at all  since his last appearance in the fire, and although  <PER>Harry</PER> knew that with Umbridge on the constant  watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him,  he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother’s  old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with  Kreacher.
“These are nice, did you  put them up?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “it was Dobby the house-elf.”   “Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large  clump of white berries placed almost over <PER>Harry</PER>’s  head.
Neither of them are brilliant, but  compared with the rest of the idiots who turned up     The arrival of <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> brought this  depressing discussion to an end and within five  minutes, the room was full enough to prevent him  seeing Angelina’s burning, reproachful looks.
“Well start  with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then  we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.”   They all divided up obediently; <PER>Harry</PER> partnered  <PER>Neville</PER> as usual.
After a  while, when <PER>Harry</PER> had unfrozen three times in a row,  he had <PER>Neville</PER> join <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again so that  he could walk around the room and watch the others.
Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and stacked them neatly away.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left before he did; he hung back a  little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping  to receive a Merry Christmas from her.
But if <PER>Voldemort</PER> really wants to  kill you, you don’t stand a chance.”   She hiccuped at the sound of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name, but  stared at <PER>Harry</PER> without flinching.
He returned to the common room half an hour later to  find <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the best seats by the fire;  nearly everybody else had gone to bed.
“What kept you?” he asked, as <PER>Harry</PER> sank into the  armchair next to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
Half  of him wanted to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what had  just happened, but the other half wanted to take the  secret with him to the grave.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, peering at  him over the tip of her quill.
“What’s up?”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a  clearer view of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> sniggered,  breaking off when <PER>Hermione</PER> caught his eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked from <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression of mingled  curiosity and hilarity to <PER>Hermione</PER>’s slight frown, and  nodded.
A reluctant grin spread over <PER>Harry</PER>’s  face as he watched <PER>Ron</PER> rolling around on the  hearthrug.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> a look of deep disgust  and returned to her letter.
“Well?” <PER>Ron</PER> said finally, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a dignified voice, dipping the  point of her quill into her ink pot, “you are the most  insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to  meet.”   “What’s that supposed to mean?” said <PER>Ron</PER>  indignantly.
“What sort of person cries while  someone’s kissing them?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly desperately, “who does?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at the pair of them with an almost  pitying expression on her face.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
Then she’ll  be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s  memory to be kissing <PER>Harry</PER> at all, and she’ll be  worrying about what everyone else might say about  her if she starts going out with <PER>Harry</PER>.
Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be  thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because  she’s been flying so badly.”   A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this  speech, then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “One person can’t feel all that  at once, they’d explode.”   “Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a  teaspoon doesn’t mean we all have,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  nastily, picking up her quill again.
“You were, weren’t you?”   “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, an unpleasant heat creeping up  his face, “I sort of — patted her on the back a bit.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though she was restraining  herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty.
“Oh well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> distantly, buried in her  letter once more, “you’ll have plenty of opportunities  to ask her...”   “What if he doesn’t want to ask her?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who  had been watching <PER>Harry</PER> with an unusually shrewd  expression on his face.
“Don’t be silly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely, “<PER>Harry</PER>’s liked  her for ages, haven’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   He did not answer.
“Who ’re you writing the novel to anyway?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked  <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to read the bit of parchment now  trailing on the floor.
They sat in  silence for another twenty minutes, <PER>Ron</PER> finishing his  Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience  and crossings-out, <PER>Hermione</PER> writing steadily to the  very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and  sealing it, and <PER>Harry</PER> staring into the fire, wishing  more than anything that Sirius’s head would appear  there and give him some advice about girls.
“What does she see in Krum?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded as he  and <PER>Harry</PER> climbed the boys’ stairs.
“Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, considering the matter, “I s’pose  he’s older, isn’t he ... and he’s an international  Quidditch player...”   “Yeah, but apart from that,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding  aggravated.
<PER>Harry</PER> put his glasses on his bedside table and  got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed  around his four-poster; instead he stared at the patch  of starry sky visible through the window next to  <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> protested... Cho shouted, “ Cedric gave me  loads of Chocolate Frog cards, look\” And she pulled  out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw  them into the air, and then turned into <PER>Hermione</PER>,  who said, “You did promise her, you know, <PER>Harry</PER>...
“<PER>Harry</PER>l”     <PER>Ron</PER> was standing over him looking extremely  frightened.
<PER>Harry</PER>l”   He had to tell <PER>Ron</PER>, it was very important that he tell  him...
“<PER>Harry</PER>, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, “you ... you were  just dreaming...”   “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously; it was crucial that <PER>Ron</PER>  understand.
“<PER>Neville</PER>’s  gone for help...”   “I’m fine!” <PER>Harry</PER> choked, wiping his mouth on his  pajamas and shaking uncontrollably.
They followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> past the silent  figures of <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, and Seamus, out of the  dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common  room, through the portrait hole, and off along the Fat  Lady’s moonlit corridor.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the  panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he  wanted to run, to yell for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
They passed Mrs. Norris,  who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed  faintly, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, “Shoo!” Mrs.        Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few  minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle  guarding the entrance to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
The door  opened of its own accord and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  led <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> inside.
“Oh, it’s you, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ... and ... ah.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting in a high-backed chair  behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of       candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before  him.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Potter has had a ... well, a  nightmare,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>,  frowning slightly.
“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about  it.” ~   “I ... well, I was asleep...” said <PER>Harry</PER> and even in his  terror and his desperation to make <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  understand he felt slightly irritated that the  headmaster was not looking at him, but examining  his own interlocked fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked from  <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, white-faced and shocked.
“How did you see this?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked quietly,  still not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Were you perhaps standing beside  the victim, or else looking down on the scene from  above?”   This was such a curious question that <PER>Harry</PER> gaped at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; it was almost as though he knew ...   “I was the snake,” he said.
“I saw it all from the  snake’s point of view...”   Nobody else spoke for a moment, then <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  now looking at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still whey-faced, said in  a new and sharper voice, “Is Arthur seriously  injured?”   “ Yes” said <PER>Harry</PER> emphatically — why were they all so  slow on the uptake, did they not realize how much a  person bled when fangs that long pierced their side?
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up so quickly that <PER>Harry</PER>  jumped, and addressed one of the old portraits  hanging very near the ceiling.
“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts ’s most  celebrated Heads,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, now sweeping  around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and  approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his  perch beside the door.
“Please sit down, all three of you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  as though <PER>Harry</PER> had not spoken.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, if you could draw up extra chairs ...”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> pulled her wand from the  pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three  chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and  wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz  armchairs that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had conjured back at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s hearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down, watching  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over his shoulder.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> now swooped down upon one of the  fragile silver instruments whose function <PER>Harry</PER> had  never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down  facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip of  his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered  whether the instrument was confirming his story: He  looked eagerly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a sign that he was  right, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look up.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> replaced the instrument upon its spindly  little table; <PER>Harry</PER> saw many of the old headmasters in  the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realizing  that <PER>Harry</PER> was watching them, hastily pretend to be  sleeping again.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “What news?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at once.
He doesn’t look  good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida  Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left — ”   “Good,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> made a convulsive  movement, “I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive,  then — ”   And moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had  reappeared in her picture too; she sank, coughing,  into her armchair and said, “Yes, they’ve taken him to  St. Mungo’s, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>...
“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other  Weasley children.”   “Of course...”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> got up and moved swiftly to the  door; <PER>Harry</PER> cast a sideways glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was  now looking terrified.
“And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — what about Molly?” said  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, pausing at the door.
“But she may already know ... that  excellent clock of hers ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was referring to the clock  that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and  conditions of the various Weasley family members,  and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand  must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it  was very late... Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not  watching the clock.
He couldn’t...   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now rummaging in a cupboard  behind <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> marched over to another portrait, this  time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard,       who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of  green and silver and was apparently sleeping so  deeply that he could not hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice  when he attempted to rouse him.
“Oh no,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I am too tired tonight...”   Something about Phineas ’s voice was familiar to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dereliction of duty!”         “We are honor-bound to give service to the present  Headmaster of Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old  wizard whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  predecessor, Armando Dippet.
“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing  this wand slightly apprehensively, “though he may  well have destroyed my picture by now, he’s done  most of the family — ”   “Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized immediately where  he had heard Phineas ’s voice before: issuing from the  apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld  Place.
Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER>  were ushered inside by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, all  three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in  their night things.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what’s going on?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER>, who looked  frightened.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> says you saw Dad  hurt — ”         “Your father has been injured in the course of his  work for the Order of the Phoenix,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak.
“My  great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in  houseguests...”   “Come here, then,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> and the  Weasleys.
“And quickly, before anyone else joins us         <PER>Harry</PER> and the others gathered around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  desk.
On  the count of three then ... one ... two ...”   It happened in a fraction of a second: In the  infinitesimal pause before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said “three,”  <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at him — they were very close  together — and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s clear blue gaze moved  from the Portkey to <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
At once, <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned white-hot, as though the  old wound had burst open again — and unbidden,  unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within  <PER>Harry</PER> a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant,  that he would like nothing better than to strike — to  bite — to sink his fangs into the man before him —   “... three.”   He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground  vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to  the kettle; he was banging into the others as all sped  forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, the  kettle pulling them onward and then —   His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees  buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground and  somewhere close at hand a voice said, “Back again,  the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying ...  ?”   “OUT!” roared a second voice.
“It was — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began; this was even worse than  telling <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, Fred,   George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> continued to stare at him for a  moment.
I expect  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s letting Molly know now.”   “We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> urgently.
<PER>Ginny</PER> said, “Somebody else  could have told us... We could have heard it  somewhere other than <PER>Harry</PER>...”   “Like who?” said Sirius impatiently.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, who made a  funny movement somewhere between a nod and  shrug, and they sat down too.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was curled like a cat on her  chair, but her eyes were open; <PER>Harry</PER> could see them  reflecting the firelight.
She was extremely pale,  but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Harry</PER> half-rising from their chairs, she gave a  wan smile.
“They might not have found Arthur for hours, and  then it would have been too late, but thanks to you  he’s alive and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been able to think up a      good cover story for Arthur being where he was,  you’ve no idea what trouble he would have been in  otherwise, look at poor Sturgis...”   <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly stand her gratitude, but  fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius  and thank him for looking after her children through  the night.
When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “but he didn’t tell me  what it meant.
Just stop worrying...”   He clapped <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder and left the pantry,  leaving <PER>Harry</PER> standing alone in the dark.
He went up to the bedroom he had shared  with <PER>Ron</PER> over the summer, but while <PER>Ron</PER> crawled  into bed and was asleep within minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> sat  fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of  the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately  uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze,  terrified that he might become the serpent again in  his sleep and awake to find that he had attacked <PER>Ron</PER>,      or else slithered through the house after one of the  others...
When <PER>Ron</PER> woke up, <PER>Harry</PER> pretended to have enjoyed  a refreshing nap too.
He pushed <PER>Harry</PER> a  little ahead of him and stumped along just behind;  <PER>Harry</PER> knew the eye was rolling in all directions under  the tilted hat.
“Everybody ready?”   They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave  <PER>Harry</PER> another shove between the shoulder blades to  urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass,  looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, her  breath steaming up the glass, “Wotcher ... We’re here  to see Arthur Weasley.”   For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought how absurd it was  for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking  that quietly through a sheet of glass, when there were  buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of  a street full of shoppers.
Fred, George, and <PER>Ron</PER> stepped after them; <PER>Harry</PER>  glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them  seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays  as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of  them seem to have noticed that six people had just  melted into thin air in front of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew  back too, but Mrs. Weasley reached out a hand and  pushed him through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly,  <PER>Harry</PER>, Arthur wants to thank you...”   The ward was small and rather dingy as the only  window was narrow and set high in the wall facing  the door.
“You know, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seems almost to have been  waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> to see something like this...”   “Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny  about the Potter kid, we all know that.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed worried about <PER>Harry</PER> when I  spoke to him this morning,” whispered Mrs. Weasley.
CHRISTMAS ON THE CLOSED WARD   Was this why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would no longer meet  <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how the snakelike face of  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had once forced itself out of the back of  Professor Quirrell’s head, and he ran his hand over  the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like  if <PER>Voldemort</PER> burst out of his skull...
I did attack  Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, <PER>Voldemort</PER> made me  do it and he could be inside me, listening to my  thoughts right now...   “Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear?” whispered Mrs.  Weasley, leaning across <PER>Ginny</PER> to speak to him as the  train rattled along through its dark tunnel.
But then <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ s about the most  powerful wizard in the world, apart from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport  people like that...   And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but  this is insane — if <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s possessing me, I’m  giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the  Order of the Phoenix right now!
His hand was on the doorknob  when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message  for you from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> spun around.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, from far, far away, “Mum  says dinner’s ready, but she’ll save you something if  you want to stay in bed...”   <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes, but <PER>Ron</PER> had already left the  room.
Squinting around the room he saw  the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in  his portrait and it occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>         had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch over him,  in case he attacked somebody else.
Anyway,” she said briskly,  “let’s go to your bedroom, <PER>Ron</PER>’s mum’s lit a fire in  there and she’s sent up sandwiches.”   <PER>Harry</PER> followed her back to the second floor.
When he  entered the bedroom he was rather surprised to see  both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> waiting for them, sitting on <PER>Ron</PER>’s  bed.
“I came on the Knight Bus,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> airily,  pulling off her jacket before <PER>Harry</PER> had time to speak.
So     She sat down next to <PER>Ginny</PER>, and the two girls and  <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Ginny</PER> say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you  got back from St. Mungo’s.”   “They do, do they?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glaring at <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked down at his feet but <PER>Ginny</PER> seemed  quite unabashed.
Well, I’m  getting used to it...”   “We wanted to talk to you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, “but as  you’ve been hiding ever since we got back — ”   “I didn’t want anyone to talk to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who  was feeling more and more nettled.
“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>  angrily, “seeing as you don’t know anyone but me  who’s been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can  tell you how it feels.”         <PER>Harry</PER> remained quite still as the impact of these  words hit him.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake,  though — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve had these dreams before,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  said.
“You had flashes of what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was up to  last year.”   “This was different,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking his head.
It was like I was the snake...  What if <PER>Voldemort</PER> somehow transported me to  London — ?”       “One day,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding thoroughly  exasperated, “you’ll read Hogwarts, A History, and  perhaps that will remind you that you can’t Apparate  or Disapparate inside Hogwarts.
Even <PER>Voldemort</PER>  couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory,  <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “You didn’t leave your bed, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of  presents at the foot of his bed and <PER>Ron</PER> already  halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.
“Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s  excellent, beats <PER>Hermione</PER>’s — she’s got me a  homework planner — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> sorted through his presents and found one with  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s handwriting on it.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had sent a furry  brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably  supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately  prevented <PER>Harry</PER> putting any money in without getting  his fingers ripped off.
Tonks’s present was a small,  working model of a Firebolt, which <PER>Harry</PER> watched fly  around the room, wishing he still had his full-size  version; <PER>Ron</PER> had given him an enormous box of  Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual  hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and  Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that <PER>Harry</PER> suspected  had been done by the elf himself.
And that perfume is really  unusual, <PER>Ron</PER>.”   “No problem,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, strolling  over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry  which <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen open.
But I  mustn’t get my hopes up...”   Fred, George, and <PER>Ron</PER> laughed; <PER>Hermione</PER>, however,  looked reproachful.
Once they had had their Christmas lunch, the  Weasleys and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were planning to  pay Mr. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye       and Lupin.
Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> —  this is absolutely wonderful — ”   For he had just opened <PER>Harry</PER>’s gift of fuse-wire and  screwdrivers.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> almost sprinted to the  door with him.
“I expect you’d like my  autograph, would you?”   “Hasn’t changed much, has he?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to  <PER>Ginny</PER>, who grinned.
It had been <PER>Ron</PER>’s malfunctioning wand  that had damaged Professor Lockhart’s memory so  badly that he had landed here in the first place,  though, as Lockhart had been attempting to  permanently wipe <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s memories at the  time, <PER>Harry</PER>’s sympathy was limited.
I can do joined-up writing now, you  know!”   “Er — we don’t want any at the moment, thanks,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, raising his eyebrows at <PER>Harry</PER>, who asked,  “Professor, should you be wandering around the  corridors?
For a few  moments he gazed intently at <PER>Harry</PER>, then he said,  “Haven’t we met?”   “Er ... yeah, we have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
It is nice of you to have come to see him —     “Er,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gesturing uselessly at the floor above,  “actually, we were just — er — ”       But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s feeble mutter of “going to have a cup of tea”  trailed away into nothingness.
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> in a low voice.
Two beds along was a woman whose  entire head was covered in fur; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered  something similar happening to <PER>Hermione</PER> during  their second year, although fortunately the damage,  in her case, had not been permanent.
He cast  around wildly for some means of distracting the  others so that <PER>Neville</PER> could leave the ward unnoticed  and unquestioned, but <PER>Ron</PER> had looked up at the  sound of the name “Longbottom” too, and before  <PER>Harry</PER> could stop him had called, “<PER>Neville</PER>\”   <PER>Neville</PER> jumped and cowered as though a bullet had  narrowly missed him.
“It’s us, <PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> brightly, getting to his feet.
Who’ve you been  visiting?”   “Friends of yours, <PER>Neville</PER>, dear?” said <PER>Neville</PER>’s  grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all.
<PER>Neville</PER> speaks most highly of you.”         “Er — thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking hands.
“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mrs. Longbottom  continued, proffering her hand regally to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Ginny</PER> in turn.
“Yes, I know your parents — not well,  of course — but fine people, fine people ... and you  must be <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather startled that Mrs.   Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the  same.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking amazed (<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to  stamp on <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, but that sort of thing was much  harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing  jeans rather than robes).
“Haven’t  you told your friends about your parents, <PER>Neville</PER>?”   <PER>Neville</PER> took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling,  and shook his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember ever  feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of  any way of helping <PER>Neville</PER> out of the situation.
They didn’t give their health and their sanity  so their only son would be ashamed of them, you  know!”   “I’m not ashamed,” said <PER>Neville</PER> very faintly, still  looking anywhere but at <PER>Harry</PER> and the others.
“My son and his wife,” she said, turning  haughtily to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, “were  tortured into insanity by You-Know- Who’s followers.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both clapped their hands over  their mouths.
<PER>Ron</PER> stopped craning his neck to catch  a glimpse of <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents and looked mortified.
“Very well, Alice dear, very well — <PER>Neville</PER>, take  it, whatever it is...”         But <PER>Neville</PER> had already stretched out his hand, into  which his mother dropped an empty Droobles  Blowing Gum wrapper.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked around at the  others, his expression defiant, as though daring them  to laugh, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not think he’d ever found  anything less funny in his life.
<PER>Neville</PER>, put that wrapper in the bin, she must  have given you enough of them to paper your  bedroom by now...”   But as they left, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure he saw <PER>Neville</PER> slip  the wrapper into his pocket.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me but I  promised I wouldn’t mention it ... that’s what  Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the  Cruciatus Curse on <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents until they lost  their minds.”         “Bellatrix Lestrange did that?” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>,  horrified.
Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his  reappearance, his bitter muttering had subsided  somewhat, and he submitted to orders more docilely  than usual, though once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> caught the  house-elf staring avidly at him, always looking quickly  away when he saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had noticed.
Then  there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he  had been banned; there was every likelihood that  their burden of homework would increase as the  exams drew even nearer; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> remained as  remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A.,  <PER>Harry</PER> felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged  him to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in  Grimmauld Place.
“<PER>Harry</PER> dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, poking her head into  his and <PER>Ron</PER>’s bedroom, where the pair of them were  playing wizard chess watched by <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>,  and Crookshanks, “could you come down to the  kitchen?
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> would like a word with  you.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not immediately register what she had said;  one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with  a pawn of <PER>Ron</PER>’s, and he was egging it on  enthusiastically.
He looked around  at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, all of whom were  gaping back at him.
“<PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
“You haven’t done anything, have you?”   “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> indignantly, racking his brains to  think what he could have done that would make  <PER>Snape</PER> pursue him to Grimmauld Place.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat  down in a chair beside Sirius, facing <PER>Snape</PER> across the  table.
“I am here on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders,” said <PER>Snape</PER>,  whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and  more quietly waspish, “but by all means stay, Black, I  know you like to feel ... involved.”   “What’s that supposed to mean?” said Sirius, letting  his chair fall back onto all four legs with a loud bang.
<PER>Snape</PER> ’s lip curled in  triumph as he turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why can’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> teach <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked Sirius  aggressively.
He was rather taller than <PER>Snape</PER> who, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed,  had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what  <PER>Harry</PER> was sure was the handle of his wand.
“If I hear  you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give <PER>Harry</PER>  a hard time, you’ll have me to answer to.”   “How touching,” <PER>Snape</PER> sneered.
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode  around the table toward <PER>Snape</PER>, pulling out his wand  as he went; <PER>Snape</PER> whipped out his own.
“I’ve warned you, Snivellus,” said Sirius, his face  barely a foot from <PER>Snape</PER> ’s, “I don’t care if <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  thinks you’ve reformed, I know better — ”   “Oh, but why don’t you tell him so?” whispered  <PER>Snape</PER>.
I expect  he’s delighted his lapdog’s working at Hogwarts, isn’t  he?”   “Speaking of dogs,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “did you know  that Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> recognized you last time you  risked a little jaunt outside?
“NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, vaulting over the table and trying  to get in between them, “Sirius, don’t — ”   “Are you calling me a coward?” roared Sirius, trying to  push <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way, but <PER>Harry</PER> would not  budge.
“Completely cured!”   He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold,  gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also       suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER>  looking toward the door with their wands pointing  into each other’s faces and <PER>Harry</PER> immobile between  them, a hand stretched out to each of them, trying to  force them apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> was separated from him by  Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to  offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to  talk to Sirius, to tell him that he should not listen to a  word <PER>Snape</PER> said, that <PER>Snape</PER> was goading him  deliberately and that the rest of them did not think  Sirius was a coward for doing as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told  him and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but he had  no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally,  eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether he  would have dared to even if he had the chance.
Instead he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> under his voice  about having to take Occlumency lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants to stop you having those dreams  about <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
“Well, you  won’t be sorry not to have them anymore, will you?”   “Extra lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding  aghast.
“I’d rather have the nightmares!”   They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus  the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and  Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the  kitchen when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived there  next morning.
He  had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know  when they would next see each other and felt that it  was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius  to stop him doing anything stupid — <PER>Harry</PER> was  worried that <PER>Snape</PER>’s accusation of cowardice had  stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning  some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place.
It would not be he, <PER>Harry</PER>,  who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no matter  how foully <PER>Snape</PER> treated him in their forthcoming  Occlumency classes.
“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clapping <PER>Harry</PER> on the  shoulder and smiling grimly, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could  say anything else, they were heading upstairs,  stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front  door, surrounded by Weasleys.
He said gruffly, “Look  after yourself, <PER>Harry</PER>,” and next moment <PER>Harry</PER> found  himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with  Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy  woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the  steps.
“On, on, get on —   And she shoved <PER>Harry</PER> forward toward the steps, past  the conductor, who goggled at <PER>Harry</PER> as he passed.
“ ’Ere — it’s ’Arry — !”     “If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,”  muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting <PER>Ginny</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> forward.
“I’ve always wanted to go on this thing,” said <PER>Ron</PER>  happily, joining <PER>Harry</PER> on board and looking around.
“Fred, George, and  <PER>Ginny</PER>, if you just take those seats at the back ...  Remus can stay with you...”   She, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> proceeded up to the  very top deck, where there were two chairs at the very  front of the bus and two at the back.
Stan Shunpike,  the conductor, followed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly to the  back.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> handed Stan eleven Sickles each,  the bus set off again, swaying ominously.
It rumbled  around Grimmauld Square, weaving on and off the  pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG,  they were all flung backward; <PER>Ron</PER>’s chair toppled  right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap,  burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to  the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder instead.
“Just outside Birmingham,” said Stan happily,  answering <PER>Harry</PER>’s unasked question as <PER>Ron</PER> struggled  up from the floor.
Looking toward the front of the bus <PER>Harry</PER> saw  <PER>Hermione</PER> cover her eyes with her hands, Pigwidgeon  still swaying happily on her shoulder.
“And listen ...” He  lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged  last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I know you  don’t like <PER>Snape</PER>, but he is a superb Occlumens and  we all — Sirius included — want you to learn to  protect yourself, so work hard, all right?”   “Yeah, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, looking up into  Lupin’s prematurely lined face.
His morning Potions lesson did nothing to  dispel his trepidation, as <PER>Snape</PER> was as unpleasant as  ever, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s mood was further lowered by the  fact that members of the D.A.
“I’ll let you know when the next one is,” <PER>Harry</PER> said  over and over again, “but I can’t do it tonight, I’ve got  to go to — er — Remedial Potions...”   “You take Remedial Potions?” asked Zacharias Smith  superciliously, having cornered <PER>Harry</PER> in the entrance         hall after lunch.
“Good Lord, you must be terrible,  <PER>Snape</PER> doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does he?”   As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant  fashion, <PER>Ron</PER> glared after him.
“Hi.”   “We’ll be in the library, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly,  and she seized <PER>Ron</PER> above the elbow and dragged him  off toward the marble staircase.
“Right ... well ... that’s settled then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and  feeling that the day was not going to be a complete  loss after all, he headed off to the library to pick up  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> before their afternoon lessons,  walking in a rather bouncy way himself.
By six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of  having successfully asked out Cho Chang was  insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that  intensified with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took toward <PER>Snape</PER>’s  office.
In a corner stood the cupboard full of  ingredients that <PER>Snape</PER> had once accused <PER>Harry</PER> — not  without reason — of robbing.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized it at once —  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down and so did <PER>Snape</PER>,  his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon <PER>Harry</PER>,  dislike etched in every line of his face.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said  <PER>Snape</PER>, his eyes narrowed malevolently, “but I am still  your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’ or  ‘Professor’ at all times.”         “Yes ... sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
As I told you back in your dear  godfather’s kitchen, this branch of magic seals the  mind against magical intrusion and influence.”   “And why does Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> think I need it,  sir?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking directly into <PER>Snape</PER>’s dark,  cold eyes and wondering whether he would answer.
It is one of the shortcomings that makes  you such a lamentable potion-maker.”   <PER>Snape</PER> paused for a moment, apparently to savor the  pleasure of insulting <PER>Harry</PER>, before continuing, “Only  Muggles talk of ‘mind reading.
Only those skilled at  Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and  memories that contradict the lie, and so utter  falsehoods in his presence without detection.”   Whatever <PER>Snape</PER> said, Legilimency sounded like mind  reading to <PER>Harry</PER> and he did not like the sound of it at  all.
Eye  contact is often essential to Legilimency.”   “Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?”   <PER>Snape</PER> eyed <PER>Harry</PER>, tracing his mouth with one long,  thin finger as he did so.
Sir?”   <PER>Snape</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER> for a few moments, still tracing  his mouth with his finger.
“As I was saying ... the vision you  had shortly before Christmas represented such a  powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord’s thoughts — ”   “I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!”   “I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?”   But <PER>Harry</PER> did not care if <PER>Snape</PER> was angry; at last he  seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts I’m sharing?”   “Do not say the Dark Lord’s name\” spat <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says his name,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  quietly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> is an extremely powerful wizard,” <PER>Snape</PER>  muttered.
“I just wanted to know,” <PER>Harry</PER> began again, forcing  his voice back to politeness, “why — ”   “You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because  that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular  moment,” snarled <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Is this just  Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> guessing, or — ?”   “I told you,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, rigid in his chair, his eyes  slits, “to call me ‘sir.’ ”   “Yes, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “but how do you  know — ?”   “It is enough that we know,” said <PER>Snape</PER> repressively.
“Which brings us back to Occlumency.”   <PER>Snape</PER> pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of  his robes and <PER>Harry</PER> tensed in his chair, but <PER>Snape</PER>  merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its  tip into the greasy roots of his hair.
Twice  more <PER>Snape</PER> raised the wand to his temple and  deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin,  then, without offering any explanation of his behavior,  he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a  shelf out of their way and returned to face <PER>Harry</PER> with  his wand held at the ready.
“And what are you going to do?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, eyeing  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s wand apprehensively.
I have been told that you have already shown  aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse... You will  find that similar powers are needed for this... Brace  yourself, now... LegilimensV’   <PER>Snape</PER> had struck before <PER>Harry</PER> was ready, before  <PER>Harry</PER> had even begun to summon any force of  resistance: the office swam in front of his eyes and  vanished, image after image was racing through his  mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to  his surroundings...
<PER>Snape</PER> ’s office had  come back into view and he realized that he had  fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided  painfully with the leg of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s desk.
“To whom  did the dog belong?”   “My Aunt Marge,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, hating <PER>Snape</PER>.
Repel me with your brain and you  will not need to resort to your wand.”   “I’m trying,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, “but you’re not telling  me how!”   “Manners, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> dangerously.
“Let go of all emotion...”   But <PER>Harry</PER>’s anger at <PER>Snape</PER> continued to pound  through his veins like venom.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked paler than usual, and  angrier, though not nearly as angry as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
He will penetrate your mind with  absurd ease, Potter!”   “I am not weak,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low voice, fury now  pumping through him so that he thought he might  attack <PER>Snape</PER> in a moment.
It looked as though, this time, <PER>Snape</PER>  had lifted the spell before <PER>Harry</PER> had even tried to  fight back.
“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?”   “What did you say?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked quietly and <PER>Harry</PER>  saw, with deep satisfaction, that <PER>Snape</PER> was  unnerved.
“And why,” said <PER>Snape</PER> slowly, “would you ask such a  thing?”   “Because,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Snape</PER> closely for a  reaction, “that corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been  dreaming about it for months — I’ve just recognized it  — it leads to the Department of Mysteries .
He was desperate to get out of  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office and find <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
As he opened it he glanced back at <PER>Snape</PER>,  who had his back to <PER>Harry</PER> and was scooping his own  thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand  and replacing them carefully inside his own head.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the library, where  they were working on Umbridge’s most recent ream of  homework.
When he sat down opposite <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> he caught sight of himself in the window  opposite.
“How did it go?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, and then,  looking concerned, “Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yeah ... fine ...
“So ... so, are you saying ...” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>, as  Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly, “that the  weapon — the thing You-Know- Who’s after — is in  the Ministry of Magic?”   “In the Department of Mysteries, it’s got to be,” <PER>Harry</PER>  whispered.
“That is a bit  odd...”   “So what’s in the Department of Mysteries?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It will be something top secret that the  Ministry has been developing, I expect... <PER>Harry</PER>, are  you sure you’re all right?”   For <PER>Harry</PER> had just run both his hands hard over his  forehead as though trying to iron it.
“So you don’t forget!”         <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged looks as he reached into  his bag, withdrew the planner and opened it  tentatively.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> told me to come and check on you,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> in a low voice, helping <PER>Harry</PER> to his feet.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and pointed at the headline  over the pictures, which <PER>Harry</PER>, concentrating on  Bellatrix, had not yet read.
”   “There you are, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking awestruck.
“That’s why he was happy last night...”   “I don’t believe this,” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>, “Fudge is blaming  the breakout on Sirius?”   “What other options does he have?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  bitterly.
“He can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> warned me this might happen, the  Azkaban guards have joined Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ — stop  whimpering, <PER>Ron</PER> — ‘and now <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s worst  supporters have broken out too.’ I mean, he’s spent a  good six months telling everyone you and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  are liars, hasn’t he?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> ripped open the newspaper and began to  read the report inside while <PER>Harry</PER> looked around the       Great Hall.
It was a different  story here: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  were deep in conversation, both looking extremely  grave.
She scowled as she gulped  down her food and every now and then she shot a  malevolent glance up the table to where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  and <PER>McGonagall</PER> were talking so intently.
She  folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it  back to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
They must be a real prat, why didn’t they check what  they were buying?”   “Oh come on, <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shakily, “I don’t  think anyone could put Devil’s Snare in a pot and not  realize it tries to kill whoever touches it?
“It ... well, I don’t know whether ...  but it’s worth trying ... and I’m the only one who can     “I hate it when she does that,” grumbled <PER>Ron</PER> as he  and <PER>Harry</PER> got up from the table and made their own,  slower way out of the Great Hall.
It’d take her about  ten more seconds — hey, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing beside the doors into the  entrance hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to  pass.
“Are you okay, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, following him as  he lumbered after the Ravenclaws.
See yeh, <PER>Harry</PER> ... <PER>Ron</PER> ...”   He trudged away, out the front doors and down the  stone steps into the damp grounds.
The fact that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was now on probation became  common knowledge within the school over the next  few days, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s indignation, hardly anybody  appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people,  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> prominent among them, seemed  positively gleeful.
As for the freakish death of an  obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St.  Mungo’s, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be the  only people who knew or cared.
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown  up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken  with almost as much fear as <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s; the crimes  they had committed during the days of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  reign of terror were legendary.
In their confusion and fear, these doubters now  seemed to be turning to the only other explanation  available to them, the one that <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been expounding since the previous  year.
“They obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom  anymore,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice, as she,   <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> passed Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the  Charms classroom one day.
If he had not been  so worried about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he would have felt sorry for  her — but if one of them was to be ousted out of a  job, there could be only one choice for <PER>Harry</PER> as to  who should remain.
Unfortunately, <PER>Harry</PER> could not see that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was  putting up a better show than Trelawney.
He was also more distant  with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> than he had ever  been before, expressly forbidding them to visit him  after dark.
It seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that Umbridge was  steadily depriving him of everything that made his life  at Hogwarts worth living: visits to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house,  letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see that all of them, even  Zacharias Smith, had been spurred to work harder  than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters  were now on the loose, but in nobody was this  improvement more pronounced than in <PER>Neville</PER>.
He  had not once mentioned his meeting with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> on the closed ward in St. Mungo’s, and  taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about  it too.
He was improving so fast it was  quite unnerving and when <PER>Harry</PER> taught them the  Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so         that they rebounded upon the attacker, only  <PER>Hermione</PER> mastered the charm faster than <PER>Neville</PER>.
In fact <PER>Harry</PER> would have given a great deal to be  making as much progress at Occlumency as <PER>Neville</PER>  was making during D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s sessions  with <PER>Snape</PER>, which had started badly enough, were  not improving; on the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> felt he was  getting worse with every lesson.
He had the horrible  impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of  aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mood, and he was sure he could date this  increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency  lesson with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  looking concerned when <PER>Harry</PER> confided in her and  <PER>Ron</PER>.
It has to get worse before  it gets better.”   “It’s lessons with <PER>Snape</PER> that are making it worse,”  said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want you to have dreams about  that corridor at all, or he wouldn’t have asked <PER>Snape</PER>  to teach you Occlumency.
“You try it  sometime, <PER>Snape</PER> trying to get inside your head, it’s  not a bundle of laughs, you know!”   “Maybe ...” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“Maybe it’s not <PER>Harry</PER>’s fault he can’t close his mind,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> darkly.
“Well, maybe <PER>Snape</PER> isn’t really trying to help <PER>Harry</PER>...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at him.
make it  easier for You-Know — ”   “Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts him, he works for  the Order, that ought to be enough.”   “He used to be a Death Eater,” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
“And we’ve never seen proof that he really swapped  sides...”       “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts him,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated.
“Are you coming?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, but he shook his  head, looking glum.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to notice <PER>Harry</PER>’s tone,  because he did not mention Quidditch again during  breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way  they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward.
<PER>Ron</PER> departed for the Quidditch pitch and <PER>Harry</PER>, after  attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his  reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone  to the entrance hall to meet Cho, feeling very  apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were  going to talk about.
It was a fresh, breezy sort of day  and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, <PER>Harry</PER>  glimpsed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> skimming over the stands  and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with  them...   “You really miss it, don’t you?” said Cho.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to  her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and he was just starting to feel confident  and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls  passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.
They moved aside  when <PER>Harry</PER> and Cho approached and <PER>Harry</PER> found  himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the      escaped Death Eaters.
“Well — I have talked about it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a  whisper, “to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, but — ”   “Oh, you’ll talk to <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger!” she said  shrilly, her face now shining with tears, and several  more kissing couples broke apart to stare.
P-perhaps it would be best if we just       ... just p-paid and you went and met up with  <PER>Hermione</PER> G-Granger, like you obviously want to!”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized  a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it.
“I don’t know why you asked me out in the first place  if you’re going to make arrangements to meet other  girls right after me... How many are you meeting after  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “It’s not like that!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he was so relieved  at finally understanding what she was annoyed about  that he laughed, which he realized a split second too  late was a mistake.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> jumped and looked down at <PER>Harry</PER> as though  he barely recognized him.
“Oh, it’s you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“You all righ’?”   “Yeah, I’m fine,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>; in fact, next to this  battered and mournful-looking <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he felt he did  not have much to complain about.
Then <PER>Hagrid</PER> said abruptly, “In  the same boat, you an’ me, aren’ we, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, unable to stop himself, “where  are you getting all these injuries?”   “Eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking startled.
“Wha’ injuries?”   “All those!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face.
“Oh ... tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, <PER>Harry</PER>,”  said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dismissively.
<PER>Harry</PER>, over here!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> was waving at him from the other side of  the room.
He was still a few tables  away when he realized that <PER>Hermione</PER> was not alone;  she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of  drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna  Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-  journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  least favorite people in the world.
“It’s none of your business if <PER>Harry</PER>’s been with a  hundred girls,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told Rita coolly.
“What are you up to?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, sitting down and  staring from Rita to Luna to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
She  took another great gulp of her drink and said out of  the corner of her mouth, “Pretty girl, is she, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “One more word about <PER>Harry</PER>’s love life and the deal’s  off and that’s a promise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably.
“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible  stories about <PER>Harry</PER> and me,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  indifferently.
“Find someone who cares, why don’t  you?”   “They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about <PER>Harry</PER>  this year without my help,” said Rita, shooting a  sideways look at him over the top of her glass and  adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made you  feel, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“You stand by all this garbage  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been telling everybody about You-  Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness  — ?”   “I wasn’t the sole witness,” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A great  bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses ...’A subheading:   ‘<PER>Harry</PER> Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And  then, beneath a nice big photograph of you:   ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who’s attack,  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, 1 5, caused outrage yesterday by  accusing respectable and prominent members of the  Wizarding community of being Death Eaters...’ ”   The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and  halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression  died out of her face.
“But of course,” she said, lowering the quill and  looking daggers at <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Little Miss Perfect  wouldn’t want that story out there, would she?”   “As a matter of fact,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sweetly, “that’s  exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.”         Rita stared at her.
Hell give you all  the details, hell tell you the names of the  undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, hell tell you  what <PER>Voldemort</PER> looks like now — oh, get a grip on  yourself,” she added contemptuously, throwing a  napkin across the table, for at the sound of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name, Rita had jumped so badly that she  had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself.
Now, if you let me write the  story from that angle — ”   “We don’t need another story about how <PER>Harry</PER>’s lost  his marbles!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
“Okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, turning to him.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not found it an easy experience to talk  about the night when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had returned.
“It’s the right thing to do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, who  was sitting opposite him.
He was rather pale, but  went on in a low voice, “It must have been ... tough ...  talking about it... Was it?”   “Yeah,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>, “but people have got to know  what <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s capable of, haven’t they?”   “That’s right,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, nodding, “and his Death  Eaters too ... People should know...”   <PER>Neville</PER> left his sentence hanging and returned to his  baked potato.
After a while Dean, Seamus, and <PER>Neville</PER> departed for  the common room, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> at the  table waiting for <PER>Ron</PER>, who had not yet had dinner  because of Quidditch practice.
"... so then,” he finished several minutes later, as the  final bit of crumble disappeared, “she jumps up,  right, and says ‘111 see you around, <PER>Harry</PER>,’ and runs  out of the place!” He put down his spoon and looked  at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“One minute we  were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me  that Roger Davies asked her out, and how she used to  go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop — how  was I supposed to feel about that?”   “Well, you see,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with the patient air of  one explaining that one plus one equals two to an  overemotional toddler, “you shouldn’t have told her  that you wanted to meet me halfway through your  date.”   “But, but,” spluttered <PER>Harry</PER>, “but — you told me to  meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I  supposed to do that without telling her — ?”   “You should have told her differently” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  still with that maddeningly patient air.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re worse than <PER>Ron</PER>... Well, no, you’re not,”  she sighed, as <PER>Ron</PER> himself came stumping into the  Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy.
It was her  way of trying to find out how much you liked her.”   “Is that what she was doing?” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER>  dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled  every dish within reach toward himself.
“Then I  could’ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn’t  have had to get herself all worked up again about  Cedric dying!”   “I’m not saying what she did was sensible,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ginny</PER> joined them, just as muddy as  <PER>Ron</PER> and looking equally disgruntled.
“I’m just trying  to make you see how she was feeling at the time.”   “You should write a book,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> as he  cut up his potatoes, “translating mad things girls do  so boys can understand them.”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fervently, looking over at the  Ravenclaw table.
Feeling rather  depressed, he looked back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Oh come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking at <PER>Ginny</PER>, “I’m  sure it wasn’t that — ”   “Yes, it was,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Angelina  was nearly in tears by the end of it.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> went off for baths after dinner; <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to the busy Gryffindor  common room and their usual pile of homework.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> not here?” asked Fred, looking  around as he pulled up a chair and, when <PER>Harry</PER>  shook his head, he said, “Good.
“Well —  that’d explain it.”         “Has <PER>Ron</PER> saved a goal yet?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, peering  over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.
“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  absentmindedly, once again bent over her Rune  translation, “it creates all this bad feeling and tension  between the Houses.”         She looked up to find her copy of Spellman’s  Syllabary and caught Fred, George, and <PER>Harry</PER> looking  at her with expressions of mingled disgust and  incredulity on their faces.
“It’s only a game,  isn’t it?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking his head, “you’re  good on feelings and stuff, but you just don’t  understand about Quidditch.”   “Maybe not,” she said darkly, returning to her  translation again, “but at least my happiness doesn’t  depend on <PER>Ron</PER>’s goalkeeping ability.”   And though <PER>Harry</PER> would rather have jumped off the  Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time he  had watched the game the following Saturday he  would have given any number of Galleons not to care  about Quidditch either.
It was  hard to say what the worst thing was: <PER>Harry</PER> thought  it was a close-run contest between <PER>Ron</PER>’s fourteenth  failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting  Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke  shrieking and falling backward off his broom as  Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle.
“Good catch,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ginny</PER> back in the common  room, where the atmosphere closely resembled that of  a particularly dismal funeral.
Anyway,  once you’re back on the team — ”   “<PER>Ginny</PER>, I’ve got a lifelong ban.”   “You’re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,”  <PER>Ginny</PER> corrected him.
Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I  prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked over at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was hunched in a  corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of butterbeer  clutched in his hand.
“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, as  though reading <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind.
“She says she knows  he’s got it in him.”   <PER>Harry</PER> liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in  <PER>Ron</PER>, but at the same time thought it would really be  kinder to let him leave the team.
Out  of respect for his feelings, <PER>Harry</PER> waited a while before  going up to the dormitory himself, so that <PER>Ron</PER> could  pretend to be asleep if he wanted to.
Sure enough,  when <PER>Harry</PER> finally entered the room <PER>Ron</PER> was snoring  a little too loudly to be entirely plausible.
Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He dreamed that <PER>Neville</PER> and Professor Sprout were  waltzing around the Room of Requirement while  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> played the bagpipes.
He stretched out his hand to push it wide  and —   <PER>Ron</PER> gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore, and <PER>Harry</PER>  awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front  of him in the darkness, to open a door that was  hundreds of miles away.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, plunging her  hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a         screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package.
I  expect all these,” she waved a hand at the assembled  owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of  <PER>Harry</PER>, “are letters from readers.”   “That’s what I thought,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> eagerly,  “<PER>Harry</PER>, d’you mind if we — ?”   “Help yourself,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling slightly bemused.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both started ripping open  envelopes.
“Says you  don’t come across as a mad person, but he really  doesn’t want to believe You-Know- Who’s back so he  doesn’t know what to think now... Blimey, what a  waste of parchment ...”   “Here’s another one you’ve convinced, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
Little though I  want to think that <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> has  returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling  the truth...’ Oh this is wonderful!”   “Another one who thinks you’re barking,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder, “but  this one says you’ve got her converted, and she now  thinks you’re a real hero — she’s put in a photograph  too — wow — ”   “What is going on here?” said a falsely sweet, girlish  voice.
He had the strangest feeling that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been watching him a second before,  but when he looked, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be  absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, don’t you see?” <PER>Hermione</PER> breathed.
By the  end of that day, though <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen so much  as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school,  the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview at  each other; <PER>Harry</PER> heard them whispering about it as  they queued up outside classes, discussing it over  lunch and in the back of lessons, while <PER>Hermione</PER>  even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in  the girls’ toilets had been talking about it when she  nipped in there before Ancient Runes.
“And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I  know you, so they were bombarding me with  questions,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, her eyes shining,  “and <PER>Harry</PER>, I think they believe you, I really do, I  think you’ve finally got them convinced!”   Meanwhile Professor Umbridge was stalking the  school, stopping students at random and demanding  that they turn out their books and pockets.
Professor Sprout  awarded Gryffindor twenty points when <PER>Harry</PER> passed  her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick      pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the  end of Charms, said “Shh\” and hurried away; and  Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during  Divination and announced to the startled class, and a  very disapproving Umbridge, that <PER>Harry</PER> was not going  to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a  ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have  twelve children.
And I’ve sent a copy  of that magazine to me mam.”   If anything more was needed to complete <PER>Harry</PER>’s  happiness, it was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle’s  reactions.
They looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> as he  browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial  Vanishment, and Goyle cracked his knuckles  threateningly and <PER>Malfoy</PER> whispered something  undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe.
“He can’t believe it, he says people seem  even more interested in this than the Crumple-  Horned Snorkacks!”   <PER>Harry</PER> was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that  night; daringly, Fred and George had put an  Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The  Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s giant  head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally  saying things like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat  dung, Umbridge” in a booming voice.
Undoubtedly that is why  he fought so hard against <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s Imperius Curse...”   “Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you  out of here!”   <PER>Ron</PER> wrenched the hangings apart, and <PER>Harry</PER> stared  up at him in the moonlight, as he lay flat on his back,  his scar searing with pain.
“Has someone been attacked again?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>,  pulling <PER>Harry</PER> roughly to his feet.
I think he said <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s dad put it  on him...”   “Bode was bewitched to remove something?” <PER>Ron</PER>  said.
“But — <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s got to be — ”   “The weapon,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished the sentence for him.
“Did you say,” murmured <PER>Ron</PER>, putting his head close  to <PER>Harry</PER>’s on the pretense of helping himself to water  from the jug on his bedside table, “that you were You-  Know-Who?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered  around noisily, pulling off their robes, and talking,  “you’ve got to tell — ”         “I haven’t got to tell anyone,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly.
He got back into bed  and rolled over onto his side with his back to <PER>Ron</PER> and  after a while he heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s mattress creak as he lay  back down too.
Somewhere,  he knew, Avery was being punished...   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited until break next morning to tell  <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what had happened.
So when  Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it  was his turn on guard duty again — he tried to get  into the department to steal the weapon for <PER>Voldemort</PER>  — <PER>Ron</PER>, be quiet — but he got caught and sent to  Azkaban...”   She gazed at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And now Rookwood’s told <PER>Voldemort</PER> how to get the  weapon?”   “I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it  sounded like,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Rookwood used to work  there... Maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ll send Rookwood to do it?”         <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded, apparently still lost in thought.
The week did not improve as it progressed: <PER>Harry</PER>  received two more D’s in Potions, was still on  tenterhooks that <PER>Hagrid</PER> might get the sack, and  could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in  which he had seen <PER>Voldemort</PER>, though he did not  bring it up with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again because he  did not want another telling-off from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get up, Potter.”     A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, <PER>Harry</PER>  was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of  <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, trying to clear his head.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s dark eyes bored into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
Remembering  what <PER>Snape</PER> had said about eye contact being crucial  to Legilimency, <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and looked away.
“It — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking everywhere but at <PER>Snape</PER>,   “it was — just a dream I had.”   “A dream,” repeated <PER>Snape</PER>.
And dim though you may be” —  <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Snape</PER>, hating him — “I would  have thought that after two months’ worth of lessons  you might have made some progress.
“That is just as well, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly,  “because you are neither special nor important, and it  is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is  saying to his Death Eaters.”   “No — that’s your job, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> shot at him.
yet  he could also see <PER>Snape</PER> standing in front of him, his  eyes fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, muttering under his  breath... And somehow, <PER>Snape</PER> was growing clearer,  and the dementors were growing fainter .
“Protegol”   <PER>Snape</PER> staggered; his wand flew upward, away from  <PER>Harry</PER> — and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind was teeming  with memories that were not his — a hook-nosed man  was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small  dark-haired boy cried in a corner.
A greasy-haired  teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his  wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies... A girl was  laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking  broomstick —   “ENOUGH!”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though he had been pushed hard in the  chest; he took several staggering steps backward, hit  some of the shelves covering <PER>Snape</PER>’s walls and heard  something crack.
He was sure he had just broken  into <PER>Snape</PER>’s memories, that he had just seen scenes  from <PER>Snape</PER>’s childhood, and it was unnerving to  think that the crying little boy who had watched his  parents shouting was actually standing in front of  him with such loathing in his eyes...   “Let’s try again, shall we?” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
They  moved back into position with the desk between  them, <PER>Harry</PER> feeling he was going to find it much  harder to empty his mind this time...   “On the count of three, then,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, raising his  wand once more.
“One — two — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not have time to gather himself together  and attempt to clear his mind, for <PER>Snape</PER> had already  cried “ Legilimens\”   He was hurtling along the corridor toward the  Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone walls,       past the torches — the plain black door was growing  ever larger; he was moving so fast he was going to  collide with it, he was feet from it and he could see  that chink of faint blue light again —   The door had flown open!
I mean, I told  you, I’ve dreamed about the door ... but it’s never  opened before...”   “You are not working hard enough!”   For some reason, <PER>Snape</PER> seemed even angrier than he  had done two minutes before, when <PER>Harry</PER> had seen  into his own memories.
“Why do you call <PER>Voldemort</PER> the Dark Lord, I’ve  only ever heard Death Eaters call him that — ”   <PER>Snape</PER> opened his mouth in a snarl — and a woman  screamed from somewhere outside the room.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was  directly opposite <PER>Harry</PER> on the other side of the hall;  she looked as though what she was watching made  her feel faintly sick.
I have dismissed her.”   To <PER>Harry</PER>’s very great surprise, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued  to smile.
“Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs,  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?”   “Of course,” said <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Might I remind you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that under  Educational Decree Twenty-two — ”   “ — the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable  candidate if — and only if — the headmaster is  unable to find one,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“She can’t get any worse  than she’s been already.”   “You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for appointing a new teacher without  consulting her,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, closing the  newspaper.
You saw  the look on her face when she saw Firenze...”   After breakfast <PER>Hermione</PER> departed for her Arithmancy  class and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed Parvati and  Lavender into the entrance hall, heading for  Divination.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when  <PER>Harry</PER> entered.
“They see this as a  betrayal of our kind.”   <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how, nearly four years ago, the  centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing  <PER>Harry</PER> to ride to safety upon his back, calling him a  “common mule.” He wondered whether it had been  Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,”  continued Firenze, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard the swishing of  his tail again as he walked up and down before them,  “but she wastes her time, in the main, on the self-   P a g e | 768<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling      flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling.
The class filed out, looking  slightly perplexed; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were on the point of  following them when Firenze called, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, a  word, please.”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, you are a friend of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, are you  not?” said the centaur.
“I would warn <PER>Hagrid</PER> myself, but I am  banished — it would be unwise for me to go too near  the forest now — <PER>Hagrid</PER> has troubles enough,  without a centaurs’ battle.”   “But — what’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> attempting to do?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  nervously.
The attemp’s  cornin’ on fine.”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’re you up to?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> seriously.
“Don’ worry abou’ me, <PER>Harry</PER>, jus’ get  along now, there’s a good lad...”         <PER>Harry</PER> had no choice but to leave <PER>Hagrid</PER> mopping up  the dung all over his floor, but he felt thoroughly  dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle.
But it was definitely  something hairy, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was  gamboling around her.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir ...” squeaked the elf, trembling from  head to foot, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir ... Dobby has come to  warn you .
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter ... she ... she ...”   Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist:  <PER>Harry</PER> seized that too.
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off <PER>Harry</PER>’s  knees; <PER>Harry</PER> held him at bay.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, yes!”   <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and looked around at the  motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing  elf.
It was only ten to nine, if  they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery,  which were both nearer —   “<PER>Harry</PER>, come on!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER> from the center  of the knot of people now fighting to get out.
He thought of <PER>Ron</PER> — Mrs. Weasley would kill him —  and of how <PER>Hermione</PER> would feel if she was expelled  before she could take her O.W.L.s.
I expect you  know why you are here?”   <PER>Harry</PER> fully intended to respond with a defiant “yes”:  His mouth had opened and the word was half formed  when he caught sight of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not looking directly at <PER>Harry</PER>; his  eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder,  but as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at him, he shook his head a  fraction of an inch to each side.
Fudge looked incredulously from <PER>Harry</PER> to Professor  Umbridge; <PER>Harry</PER> took advantage of his momentary  inattention to steal another quick look at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods  and the shadow of a wink.
“There’s nothing like a good witness, is there,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   “Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely,  inclining his head.
“So she can speak freely?”   “I have not yet managed to find one,” Umbridge  admitted grudgingly, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a surge of pride in  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jinxing ability.
Do you have any evidence  that these meetings continued?”   As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a rustle behind  him and rather thought Kingsley whispered  something.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’sArmy.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached out and took the piece of  parchment from Fudge.
“Would you  like a written confession from me, Cornelius — or will  a statement before these witnesses suffice?”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Kingsley look at each  other.
“What — I don’t — ?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army, Cornelius,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  still smiling as he waved the list of names before  Fudge’s face.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him,   <PER>McGonagall</PER> widened her eyes threateningly, but it  had suddenly dawned upon <PER>Harry</PER> what <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  was about to do, and he could not let it happen.
“No — Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “Be quiet, <PER>Harry</PER>, or I am afraid you will have to leave  my office,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“I see no snag, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “Well,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> apologetically, “I’m afraid I  do.”   “Oh really?”   “Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under  the delusion that I am going to — what is the phrase?
“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering himself, “you intend  to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself  single-handed, do you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   “Merlin’s beard, no,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled around to see who was half-  strangling him and saw Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  crouched beside him.
“Yes!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, getting up and  dragging <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta with her.
“Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best  if they do not know that we had time to communicate   — you must act as though no time has passed, as         though they were merely knocked to the ground, they  will not remember — ”   “Where will you go, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” whispered  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Fudge will soon wish  he’d never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise  you...”   “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ...” <PER>Harry</PER> began.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist.
“Remember — close your mind — ”   But as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s fingers closed over <PER>Harry</PER>’s skin,  a pain shot through the scar on his forehead, and he  felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to bite him, to hurt him —   “ — you will understand,” whispered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> released <PER>Harry</PER>, raised his hand, and  grasped the phoenix’s long golden tail.
“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his  torn shirtsleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your  friend <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “You think so, do you?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  scornfully.
“You’d better get those two off to bed,” said Fudge,  looking back at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> with a  dismissive nod toward <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta.
“You know, Minister, I disagree with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on  many counts ... but you cannot deny he’s got style...”           SNAPE’S WORST MEMORY   — BY ORDER OF —   THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC   Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced  Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as Head of Hogwarts School of  Witchcraft and Wizardry.
No matter where <PER>Harry</PER> went within the castle next  day, the sole topic of conversation was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  flight, and though some of the details might have  gone awry in the retelling (<PER>Harry</PER> overheard one  second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was  now lying in St. Mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head),  it was surprising how accurate the rest of their  information was.
Everybody seemed aware, for  instance, that <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta were the only  students to have witnessed the scene in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing,  <PER>Harry</PER> found himself besieged with requests to give a  firsthand account wherever he went.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> will be back before long,” said Ernie  Macmillan confidently on the way back from  Herbology after listening intently to <PER>Harry</PER>’s story.
The Fat Friar told me  ...” He dropped his voice conspiratorially, so that  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had to lean closer to him  to hear, "... that Umbridge tried to get back into his  office last night after they’d searched the castle and  grounds for him.
“Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid  puffed-up, power-crazy old — ”   “Now, do you really want to finish that sentence,  Granger?”         <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had slid out from behind the door,  followed by Crabbe and Goyle.
So, Granger, I’ll have five from you  for being rude about our new headmistress...  Macmillan, five for contradicting me... Five because I  don’t like you, Potter ... Weasley, your shirt’s  untucked, so I’ll have another five for that... Oh yeah,   I forgot, you’re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for  that...”   <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his wand, but <PER>Hermione</PER> pushed it  away, whispering, “Don’t!”   “Wise move, Granger,” breathed <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
It would completely undermine the  prefect system...”   But <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned  automatically toward the giant hourglasses set in  niches along the wall behind them, which recorded  the House points.
He and George had just come down the marble  staircase and joined <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Ernie  in front of the hourglasses.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> just docked us all about fifty points,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, as they watched several more stones  fly upward from the Gryffindor hourglass.
“Just in case ...”   “Yeah, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and the three of them  moved toward the doors to the Great Hall, but <PER>Harry</PER>  had barely glimpsed today’s ceiling of scudding white  clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder  and, turning, he found himself almost nose to nose  with Filch, the caretaker.
“Follow me...”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were  both looking worried.
One of the horrible painted  kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes  just like Mad-Eye Moody’s magical one, and it had  just occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> what Mad-Eye would say if he  ever heard that <PER>Harry</PER> had drunk anything offered by  a known enemy.
“Where is Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER> promptly.
“If you want to  add your name to the waiting list, <PER>Hermione</PER>, it’s five  Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the  Deflagration Deluxe...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to the table where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though  hoping their homework might spring out of it and  start doing itself.
I think I’m feeling a bit ... rebellious.”   <PER>Harry</PER> could still hear the distant bangs of escaped  firecrackers when he and <PER>Ron</PER> went up to bed an hour       later, and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past  the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word POO.
“I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket  and it’s like they mated, come and see!”   <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> and Dean scramble out of bed for a  better look.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the whole of the next day dreading what  <PER>Snape</PER> was going to say if he found out how much  farther into the Department of Mysteries he had  penetrated during his last dream.
“Over here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad of a reason to postpone  his meeting with <PER>Snape</PER> and beckoning her across to  the corner of the entrance hall where the giant  hourglasses stood.
“No, it was only ... Well, I  just wanted to say ... <PER>Harry</PER>, I never dreamed Marietta  would tell...”   “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> moodily.
“You know, her mum works for the  Ministry, it’s really difficult for her — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad works for the Ministry too!” <PER>Harry</PER> said  furiously.
“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s idea — ”   “Don’t start crying again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> warningly.
Fuming, <PER>Harry</PER> descended the stairs to <PER>Snape</PER>’s  dungeon, and though he knew from experience how  much easier it would be for <PER>Snape</PER> to penetrate his  mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded  in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he  should have said to Cho about Marietta before  reaching the dungeon door.
“You’re late, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, as <PER>Harry</PER>  closed the door behind him.
<PER>Snape</PER> was standing with his back to <PER>Harry</PER>, removing,  as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them  carefully in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve.
“Have you been practicing?”   “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of  <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk.
“Wand out, Potter.”   <PER>Harry</PER> moved into his usual position, facing <PER>Snape</PER>  with the desk between them.
“One  — two — ”   <PER>Snape</PER>’s office door banged open and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>  sped in.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, sir — oh — sorry — ”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> was looking at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> in some  surprise.
“It’s all right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, lowering his wand.
“Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Malfoy</PER> look so gleeful since  Umbridge had turned up to inspect <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, what is it?” asked <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> mouthed  “Remedial Potions?” at <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s back  before following him.
things he did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to see if he  broke through <PER>Snape</PER>’s defenses accidentally...   <PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside  him... What was it that <PER>Snape</PER> was so keen to hide  from <PER>Harry</PER>?
Montague was Captain of the Slytherin  Quidditch team, <PER>Snape</PER> would want to make sure he  was all right...   <PER>Harry</PER> walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve  and stood over it, gazing into its depths.
He was trembling... <PER>Snape</PER> could be  back at any moment ... but <PER>Harry</PER> thought of Cho’s  anger, of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s jeering face, and a reckless daring  seized him.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved  around behind <PER>Snape</PER> and read the heading of the  examination paper:   DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS —       ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL     So <PER>Snape</PER> had to be fifteen or sixteen, around <PER>Harry</PER>’s  own age.
James’s hair  stuck up at the back exactly as <PER>Harry</PER>’s did, his hands  could have been <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that  when James stood up, they would be within an inch  of each other’s heights.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and glimpsed <PER>Snape</PER> a short way  away, moving between the tables toward the doors  into the entrance hall, still absorbed in his own  examination paper.
A gang of chattering girls separated <PER>Snape</PER> from  James and Sirius, and by planting himself in the  midst of this group, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to keep <PER>Snape</PER> in  sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of  James and his friends.
<PER>Snape</PER>  remained close by, still buried in his examination  questions; but this was <PER>Snape</PER>’s memory, and <PER>Harry</PER>  was sure that if <PER>Snape</PER> chose to wander off in a  different direction once outside in the grounds, he,  <PER>Harry</PER>, would not be able to follow James any farther.
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree  on the edge of the lake where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had spent a Sunday finishing their  homework, and threw themselves down on the grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to  his delight, that <PER>Snape</PER> had settled himself on the  grass in the dense shadows of a clump of bushes.
<PER>Snape</PER> reacted so fast it was as though he had been  expecting an attack: Dropping his bag, he plunged his  hand inside his robes, and his wand was halfway into  the air when James shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’   <PER>Snape</PER> ’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with  a little thud in the grass behind him.
“Who wants to see me take off Snivelly’s pants?”   But whether James really did take off <PER>Snape</PER>’s pants,  <PER>Harry</PER> never found out.
Wincing,  <PER>Harry</PER> looked around to see who had hold of him, and  saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized  <PER>Snape</PER> standing right beside him, white with rage.
Then, with a swooping feeling as       though he had turned head over heels in midair, his  feet hit the stone floor of <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, and he  was standing again beside the Pensieve on <PER>Snape</PER>’s  desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s  study.
“So,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly  <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand was starting to feel numb.
“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?” said <PER>Snape</PER>,  shaking <PER>Harry</PER> so hard that his glasses slipped down  his nose.
“I — didn’t — ”   <PER>Snape</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> from him with all his might.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting to his feet as far from <PER>Snape</PER>  as he could.
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower  so early, nor to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what he had  just seen.
What was making <PER>Harry</PER> feel so horrified  and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars  thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be  humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew  exactly how <PER>Snape</PER> had felt as his father had taunted  him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his  father had been every bit as arrogant as <PER>Snape</PER> had  always told him.
“<PER>Snape</PER> reckons I can  carry on by myself now I’ve got the basics...”   “So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically.
“Well, I don’t think <PER>Snape</PER> should stop until you’re  absolutely sure you can control them!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  indignantly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think you should go back to  him and ask — ”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> forcefully.
“Just drop it, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  okay?”   It was the first day of the Easter holidays and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, as was her custom, had spent a large part  of the day drawing up study schedules for the three of      them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had let her do it — it was easier  than arguing with her and, in any case, they might  come in useful.
“How can that come as a shock?” <PER>Hermione</PER>  demanded, as she tapped each little square on <PER>Ron</PER>’s  schedule with her wand so that it flashed a different  color according to its subject.
“I dunno ...” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “there’s been a lot going on...”   “Well, there you are,” she said, handing him his  schedule, “if you follow that you should do fine.”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
“I saw Cho earlier,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, “and  she looked really miserable too... Have you two had a  row again?”   “Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing  gratefully on the excuse.
“If it hadn’t been for  her ...”   <PER>Ron</PER> went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe,  which <PER>Harry</PER> found helpful.
Hadn’t people like <PER>Hagrid</PER> and  Sirius told <PER>Harry</PER> how wonderful his father had been?
Yes, he had once overheard Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> saying that his father and Sirius had  been troublemakers at school, but she had described  them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and <PER>Harry</PER>      could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone  upside down for the fun of it ... not unless they really  loathed them .
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a case for <PER>Snape</PER> having deserved  what he had suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t  Lily asked, “What’s he done to you?” And hadn’t  James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you  know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all  simply because Sirius said he was bored?
<PER>Harry</PER>  remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place  that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had made him prefect in the hope  that he would be able to exercise some control over  James and Sirius...
It was late on Sunday  evening; <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone back to Gryffindor Tower  to review Ancient Runes; <PER>Ron</PER> had Quidditch practice.
“Are you okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER> quietly.
“Well,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> slowly, helping herself to a bit of  egg too, “if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect  we could think of a way to do it...”   “Come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hopelessly.
“With Umbridge  policing the fires and reading all our mail?”   “The thing about growing up with Fred and George,”  said <PER>Ginny</PER> thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start       thinking anything’s possible if you’ve got enough  nerve.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked at her.
“Out — out  — OUT!”   And whipping out her wand, she caused <PER>Harry</PER>’s  books, bag, and ink bottle to chase him and <PER>Ginny</PER>  from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the  head as they ran.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down the list and found that he was  expected in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office at half-past  two on Monday, which would mean missing most of  Divination.
Then consider a position with Gringotts  Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-   P a g e | 838<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling      Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad...’ They  want Arithmancy, though... You could do it,  <PER>Hermione</PER>!”   “I don’t much fancy banking,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely,  now immersed in HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES  TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?
“Yeah ...” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I  thought I’d like — ”   “Don’t be so ridiculous,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, straightening  up and looking at him as though she could not  believe her eyes.
“And if we’re going to be causing a  bit of uproar, why not do it so that <PER>Harry</PER> can have his  chat with Sirius?”   “Yes, but still,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with an air of  explaining something very simple to somebody very  obtuse, “even if you do cause a diversion, how is  <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to talk to him?”   “Umbridge’s office,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“So even if she’s  bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t work, which I  bet she has — ”   “What do you think about this?” <PER>Hermione</PER> demanded  of <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was reminded irresistibly of Mrs.  Weasley appealing to her husband during <PER>Harry</PER>’s first  dinner in Grimmauld Place.
“If <PER>Harry</PER> wants to do it, it’s up to  him, isn’t it?”   “Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred,  clapping <PER>Ron</PER> hard on the back.
It was not only the prospect  of breaking into Umbridge’s office and using her fire       to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous,  though that was certainly bad enough — today also  happened to be the first time he would be in close  proximity with <PER>Snape</PER> since <PER>Snape</PER> had thrown him  out of his office, as they had Potions that day.
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day  ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> got up very quietly and moved across to  the window beside <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed, staring out on a truly  glorious morning.
Directly ahead of him, <PER>Harry</PER> could  see the towering beech tree below which his father  had once tormented <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted into  the sun and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> emerging from between the  trees.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched,  <PER>Hagrid</PER> staggered to the door of his cabin and  disappeared inside it.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> did not emerge again, but  smoke furled from the chimney, so <PER>Hagrid</PER> could not  be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking  the fire...   <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from the window, headed back to  his trunk, and started to dress.
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge’s  office ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> had never expected the day to be a  restful one, but he had not reckoned on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what  he was planning to do at five o’clock.
For the first time      ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor  Binns in History of Magic as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were,  keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that  <PER>Harry</PER> tried very hard to ignore.
"... and if she does catch you there, apart from being  expelled, shell be able to guess you’ve been talking to  Snuffles and this time I expect she’ll force you to  drink Veritaserum and answer her questions...”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low and indignant voice,  “are you going to stop telling <PER>Harry</PER> off and listen to  Binns, or am I going to have to take notes instead?”   “You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!”   By the time they reached the dungeons, neither <PER>Harry</PER>  nor <PER>Ron</PER> was speaking to <PER>Hermione</PER> any longer.
<PER>Snape</PER>, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as  though <PER>Harry</PER> were invisible.
At the  end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a  flask, corked it, and took it up to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk for  marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an  E.         He had just turned away when he heard a smashing  noise; <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave a gleeful yell of laughter.
“I’m really sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, I thought you’d  finished, so I cleared up!”   <PER>Harry</PER> could not bring himself to answer.
When the  bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a  backward glance and made sure that he found  himself a seat between <PER>Neville</PER> and Seamus for lunch  so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could not start nagging him about  using Umbridge’s office again.
He was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to  Divination that he had quite forgotten his career  appointment with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  remembering only when <PER>Ron</PER> asked him why he  wasn’t in her office.
“Yes?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> prompted <PER>Harry</PER>.
I’m quite sure I slipped in  a note ...”   “What, this thing?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> in a  tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink  parchment from between the leaves of <PER>Harry</PER>’s folder.
“He has  achieved high marks in all his Defense Against the  Dark Arts tests — ”   “I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva,  but as you will see from my note, <PER>Harry</PER> has been  achieving very poor results in his classes with me — ”   “I should have made my meaning plainer,” said  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning at last to look  Umbridge directly in the eyes.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>, her thin  nostrils flared, her eyes burning.
Their criminal  records.”   “ — unless you’re prepared to take even more exams  after Hogwarts, you should really look at another — ”   “ — which means that this boy has as much chance of  becoming an Auror as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has of ever  returning to this school.”   “A very good chance, then,” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were  planning to do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, the  moment they had opened their books to chapter  thirty- four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”).
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sacrificed himself to keep you in school,  <PER>Harry</PER>!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, raising her book to hide         her face from Umbridge.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said  in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the  class.
He would not look at <PER>Harry</PER>, though when  <PER>Hermione</PER> opened her mouth to try dissuading <PER>Harry</PER>  some more, he said in a low voice, “Give it a rest,  okay?
“<PER>Harry</PER> — please!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> weakly.
“Look, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and  <PER>Snape</PER> hated each other from the moment they set  eyes on each other, it was just one of those things,  you can understand that, can’t you?
And <PER>Snape</PER> was just this little  oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and      James — whatever else he may have appeared to you,  <PER>Harry</PER> — always hated the Dark Arts.”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but he just attacked <PER>Snape</PER> for no  good reason, just because — well, just because you  said you were bored,” he finished with a slightly  apologetic note in his voice.
“Even <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I mean, James didn’t take <PER>Snape</PER>  on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did  he?”   Sirius frowned at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still looking  unconvinced.
“I just never thought  I’d feel sorry for <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease  between his eyebrows, “how did <PER>Snape</PER> react when he  found you’d seen all this?”   “He told me he’d never teach me Occlumency again,”  said <PER>Harry</PER> indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint     “He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to jump  and inhale a mouthful of ashes.
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, first of all, you’re to go back to  <PER>Snape</PER> and tell him that on no account is he to stop  giving you lessons — when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hears — ”   “I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me!” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  outraged.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had  his bag and the Invisibility Cloak was completely  covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried  out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along  faster than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him go.
<PER>Harry</PER>  was certain that teachers like <PER>McGonagall</PER> or Flitwick  could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just  as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire Whiz-  Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge  struggle.
Indeed, a week after Fred and  George’s departure <PER>Harry</PER> witnessed Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> walking right past Peeves, who was  determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and  could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out  of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews the other  way.”   To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from  his sojourn in the toilet.
“Reparo\” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, mending <PER>Ron</PER>’s cup  with a wave of her wand.
They’ll  need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in  Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know what they’ve been  up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold...”         “Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around  <PER>Harry</PER>’s, whose stubby little legs were still unable to  touch the desktop.
“How do you know?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“  ’Specially if she thinks they’re receiving stolen  cauldrons or something...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson,  but <PER>Harry</PER> had a shrewd suspicion that her self-  restraint was bound to crack before long.
<PER>Ron</PER> snorted disbelievingly and <PER>Hermione</PER> threw him a  very dirty look.
“As a matter of fact, I  was going to ask <PER>Harry</PER> when he’s going to go back to  <PER>Snape</PER> and ask for Occlumency lessons again!”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank.
Once they had exhausted the  subject of Fred and George’s dramatic departure,  which admittedly had taken many hours, <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had wanted to hear news of Sirius.
He had been regretting  this ever since; <PER>Hermione</PER> would not let the subject  drop and kept reverting to it when <PER>Harry</PER> least  expected it.
“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny  dreams,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said now, “because <PER>Ron</PER> told me  last night you were muttering in your sleep again...”       <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Ron</PER> a furious look.
“You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking beadily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose ears were still flaming  red, “if Montague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play  Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning  the Cup.”   “Yeah, I s’pose so,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad of a change of  subject.
“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly over breakfast on the morning  of the match.
“Nothing to lose now, is there?”   “You know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as she and <PER>Harry</PER> walked  down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very  excitable crowd, “I think <PER>Ron</PER> might do better without  Fred and George around.
<PER>Ron</PER> could not wish for better,  and <PER>Harry</PER> found himself hoping against hope that  <PER>Ron</PER> would not give the Slytherins cause for more  rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.”   Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred  and George had left, was commentating as usual.
“And he’s scored.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> groaned with the rest of the  Gryffindors.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said a hoarse voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>     <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s enormous  bearded face sticking between the seats; apparently  he had squeezed his way all along the row behind, for  the first and second years he had just passed had a  ruffled, flattened look about them.
While ev’ryone’s watchin’ the match?”   “Er ... can’t it wait, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ ’Course,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, “ ’course we’ll come...”   He and <PER>Hermione</PER> edged back along their row of seats,  causing much grumbling among the students who  had to stand up for them.
“Give us more time ...”   “What is it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at  him with a concerned expression on her face as they  hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest.
When they reached his cabin, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned  automatically left toward the front door; <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  however, walked straight past it into the shade of the  trees on the outermost edge of the forest, where he  picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree.
“C’mon now, quick, before we’re  spotted!”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, then  ducked into the cover of the trees behind <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who  was already striding away from them into the green  gloom, his crossbow over his arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> ran to catch up with him.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, why are you armed?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Firenze said that they’re angry because he went to  work for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, tripping on a  protruding root because he was busy watching  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s profile.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, startled,  but <PER>Hagrid</PER>, scowling, did not elaborate.
“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily  than usual, “since then the other centaurs Ve bin livid  with me an’ the trouble is, they’ve got a lot of  influence in the forest... Cleverest creatures in here     “Is that why we’re here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
They were soon a long way past the clearing  where <PER>Hagrid</PER> had shown them the thestrals, but  <PER>Harry</PER> felt no sense of unease until <PER>Hagrid</PER> stepped  unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way  in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, fighting his way through thickly  knotted brambles over which <PER>Hagrid</PER> had stepped  easily and remembering very vividly what had  happened to him on the other occasions he had  stepped off the forest path.
“C’mon,  <PER>Harry</PER>... We need ter keep together now...”   It was a great struggle to keep up with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, what  with branches and thickets of thorn through which       <PER>Hagrid</PER> marched as easily as though they were  cobwebs, but which snagged <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  robes, frequently entangling them so severely that  they had to stop for minutes at a time to free  themselves.
They were so deep in the  forest now that sometimes all <PER>Harry</PER> could see of  <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead  of him.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, would it be all right if we lit our wands?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“Before we ge’ there, like.”   “Good!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> set her back on her  feet.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face swam through the gloom by  the light of the two wavering beams and <PER>Harry</PER> saw  that he looked nervous and sad again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, then back  at him.
I don’ wan’ ter go, o’ course, but if it  wasn’ fer ... well ... the special circumstances I’m  abou’ ter explain to yeh, I’d leave righ now, before  she’s go’ the chance ter do it in front o’ the whole  school, like she did with Trelawney.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both made noises of protest, but  <PER>Hagrid</PER> overrode them with a wave of one of his  enormous hands.
An’ <PER>Ron</PER>, if he’s  willin’.”   “Of course well help you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“What  do you want us to do?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave a great sniff and patted <PER>Harry</PER> wordlessly  on the shoulder with such force that <PER>Harry</PER> was  knocked sideways into a tree.
<PER>Harry</PER> had opened his mouth to ask how much farther  they had to go when <PER>Hagrid</PER> threw out his right arm to  signal that they should stop.
“Very quiet, now ...”   They crept forward and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they were  facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall  as <PER>Hagrid</PER> that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was  sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.
Trees  had been ripped up at the roots all around the  mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground  surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that  formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> now stood.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she said in a whisper barely audible over  the sound of the sleeping creature, “who is he?”   <PER>Harry</PER> found this an odd question... “What is it?” was  the one he had been planning on asking.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you told us,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her wand now  shaking in her hand, “you told us none of them  wanted to come!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked from her to <PER>Hagrid</PER> and then, as  realization hit him, he looked back at the mound with  a small gasp of horror.
The great mound of earth, on which he, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  and <PER>Hagrid</PER> could easily have stood, was moving  slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting  breathing.
“But I had ter bring him,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, I had ter!”   “But why?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, who sounded as though  she wanted to cry.
“Why — what — oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>\”   “I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, sounding  close to tears himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few  manners — I’d be able ter take him outside an’ show  ev’ryone he’s harmless!”   “Harmless!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> made  frantic hushing noises with his hands as the  enormous creature before them grunted loudly and  shifted in its sleep.
“Oh <PER>Hagrid</PER>, why did you  bring him back if he didn’t want to come, wouldn’t he  have been happier with his own people?”   “They were all bullyin’ him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, ’cause he’s so  small!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Small?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I couldn’ leave him,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, tears  now trickling down his bruised face into his beard.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, when you say ‘brother,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly,  “do you mean — ?”   “Well — half-brother,” amended <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
’Course, he covers the ground pretty well  when he wants ter, but he kep’ wantin’ ter go back...”   “Oh <PER>Hagrid</PER>, why on earth didn’t you let him!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, flopping down onto a ripped-up tree and  burying her face in her hands.
“So what is it you want <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and me to do?”  <PER>Hermione</PER> asked apprehensively.
“After I’m  gone.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged miserable looks,   <PER>Harry</PER> uncomfortably aware that he had already  promised <PER>Hagrid</PER> that he would do whatever he asked.
Of course, the other creatures who lived  in the forest would have heard <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fruitless  attempts to teach Grawp English...   “Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER> hopefully.
“ ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter  people, he’ll understand more that we all like him  really, an’ want him to stay...”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who peered back at him  from between the fingers over her face.
“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who did not seem to  have caught what <PER>Harry</PER> had just said.
“We’ll try, <PER>Hagrid</PER>...”         “I knew I could count on yeh, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said,  beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face  with his handkerchief again.
If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer  Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little  chat with him ... I’ll wake him up, then — introduce  you — ”   “Wha — no!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, jumping up, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, no,  don’t wake him, really, we don’t need — ”   But <PER>Hagrid</PER> had already stepped over the great trunk  in front of them and was proceeding toward Grawp.
When he was around ten feet away, he lifted a long,  broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly  over his shoulder at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and then  poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the  end of the bough.
In front of <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was  rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed  an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his  knees and turned his head to see who and what had  disturbed him.
“Had a nice sleep, eh?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated as far as they could  while still keeping the giant within their sights.
“Oh my ...” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> squeal, terrified,  beside him.
Remember that, Grawpy?”   But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard  to say whether he was listening to <PER>Hagrid</PER> or whether  he even recognized the sounds <PER>Hagrid</PER> was making as  speech.
Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some  friends!”   “Oh <PER>Hagrid</PER>, don’t,” moaned <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>  had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp’s  knee a sharp poke.
“This,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, hastening over to where <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood, “is <PER>Harry</PER>, Grawp!
He migh’ be cornin’ ter visit yeh if I have ter go away,  understand?”   The giant had only just realized that <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were there.
Turning to <PER>Hermione</PER> he said, “Would yeh mind if he  called yeh Hermy, <PER>Hermione</PER>?
Two friends fer yeh ter —  GRAWPY, NO!”         Grawp’s hand had shot out of nowhere toward  <PER>Hermione</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> seized her and pulled her  backward behind the tree, so that Grawp’s fist  scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.
“BAD BOY, GRAWPY!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelling, as  <PER>Hermione</PER> clung to <PER>Harry</PER> behind the tree, shaking  and whimpering.
YEH DON’ GRAB   — OUCH!”   <PER>Harry</PER> poked his head out from around the trunk and  saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> lying on his back, his hand over his nose.
“We’ll — er — we’ll go back now, shall we?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded.
And he had promised that he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> would continue <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s totally pointless  attempts to civilize the giant... How could <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  even with his immense capacity to delude himself  that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool  himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with  humans?
“Hold it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> abruptly, just as <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were struggling through a patch of thick  knotgrass behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands;  now that they had stopped walking, they too could  hear movement close by.
“There can be no  return from such disgrace.”   “If yeh say so,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, shrugging, “but  personally I think yeh ’re makin’ a big mistake — ”   “As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into  our forest when we warned you — ”   “Now, you listen ter me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> angrily.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a high-pitched and  terrified voice, as both Bane and the gray centaur  pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please lets go!
“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much  his forest as yours!” he yelled, while <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> both pushed with all their might against  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him  moving forward.
“Ruddy old nags  though, eh?”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, skirting the  patch of nettles they had passed on their way there,  “if the centaurs don’t want humans in the forest, it  doesn’t really look as though <PER>Harry</PER> and I will be able     “Ah, you heard what they said,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  dismissively “They wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean,  kids.
Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be pushed around  by that lot...”   “Nice try,” <PER>Harry</PER> murmured to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked  crestfallen.
“Well ... see you later, then,  <PER>Hagrid</PER>...”   “I don’t believe him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a very  unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot  of <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“He’s not asking us to do anything unless he  gets chucked out and that might not even happen — ”   “Oh come off it, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily,  stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind  her had to swerve to avoid her.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> ...” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched them go,  beaming, until the last echoing strains of “Weasley Is  Our King” died away.
All he wanted to do was talk over  the match and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> found it very  difficult to find an opening in which to mention  Grawp — not that either of them tried very hard;  neither was keen to be the one to bring <PER>Ron</PER> back to  reality in quite such a brutal fashion.
“And then, when Chambers came at me about five  minutes later — what?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, stopping mid-  sentence at the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
The truth was that <PER>Ron</PER> had just reminded  <PER>Harry</PER> forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player  who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very  tree.
Did you see the look on Chang’s face when <PER>Ginny</PER> got  the Snitch right out from under her nose?”   “I suppose she cried, did she?” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“Well, actually ... no, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a  heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him  apologetically.
“As a matter of fact, the only bit of the  match <PER>Harry</PER> and I saw was Davies’s first goal.”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with  disappointment.
“But <PER>Ron</PER>, we didn’t want  to leave — we had to!”   “Yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose face was growing rather red.
“How come?”   “It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
But  unfortunately, he made <PER>Harry</PER> and me promise.”   “Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise,  that’s all,” said <PER>Ron</PER> firmly.
Have we  ever come off better for mixing with any of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s  monster mates?”   “I know, it’s just that — we promised,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  in a small voice.
The purposeful, feverish atmosphere  drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from <PER>Harry</PER>’s  mind, though he did wonder occasionally during  Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told <PER>Snape</PER>  that he must continue giving <PER>Harry</PER> Occlumency  tuition: If he had, then <PER>Snape</PER> had ignored Lupin as  thoroughly as he was now ignoring <PER>Harry</PER>.
This suited  <PER>Harry</PER> very well; he was quite busy and tense enough  without extra classes with <PER>Snape</PER>, and to his relief  <PER>Hermione</PER> was much too preoccupied these days to  badger him about Occlumency.
“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he  demanded of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> as they queued outside  Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.
Meanwhile <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had found a different way to  induce panic.
Now, Father’s been friendly with the head of  the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old  Griselda Marchbanks — we’ve had her round for  dinner and everything...”   “Do you think that’s true?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered to  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, looking frightened.
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a  friend of my gran’s, and she’s never mentioned the  <PER>Malfoy</PER>s.”   “What’s she like, <PER>Neville</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced at one another, but didn’t know  what to say.
<PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> were much tempted by the bottle of  Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw  sixth year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely  responsible for the nine “Outstanding” O.W.L.s he  had gained the previous summer and was offering the  whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons.
<PER>Ron</PER> assured  <PER>Harry</PER> he would reimburse him for his half the  moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before  they could close the deal, <PER>Hermione</PER> had confiscated  the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents  down a toilet.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we wanted to buy that!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It’s supposed to  be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you  come over all cunning for a few hours — <PER>Hermione</PER>,  let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt — ”   “This stuff can,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“I’ve had a  look at it, and it’s actually dried doxy droppings.”   This information took the edge off <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s  desire for brain stimulants.
Our  new — headmistress” — Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  pronounced the word with the same look on her face  that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was  contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt —      “has asked the Heads of House to tell their students  that cheating will be punished most severely —  because, of course, your examination results will  reflect upon the headmistress’s new regime at the  school...”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> gave a tiny sigh.
You have your own futures to think about.”   “Please, Professor,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her hand in the  air, “when will we find out our results?”   “An owl will be sent to you some time in July,” said  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> agreed to test <PER>Hermione</PER> after  lunch on Sunday but regretted it almost at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having  studied hard all day.
Is that the examiners?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> whipped around on their bench.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded and they hastened  toward the double doors into the entrance hall,  slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to  walk sedately past the examiners.
“No idea  where he is, I suppose?”   “None at all,” said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent  look at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were now  dawdling around the foot of the stairs as <PER>Ron</PER>  pretended to do up his shoelace.
Examined him personally in Transfiguration  and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s ... Did things  with a wand I’d never seen before ...”   “Yes ... well ...” said Professor Umbridge as <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged their feet up the marble  staircase as slowly as they dared, “let me show you to  the staffroom ...
Parvati was practicing incantations  under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her  twitched, <PER>Hermione</PER> was rereading Achievement in  Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred, and  <PER>Neville</PER> kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking  over the marmalade.
Then, at half-past nine,  they were called forward class by class to reenter the  Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as <PER>Harry</PER>  had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius,  and <PER>Snape</PER> had been taking their O.W.L.s.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned over his paper, his heart thumping  hard... Three rows to his right and four seats ahead,  <PER>Hermione</PER> was already scribbling.
I wasn’t  sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much — and  on question twenty-three — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sternly, “we’ve been through  this before... We’re not going through every exam  afterward, it’s bad enough doing them once.”   The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school  (the four House tables reappeared over the lunch  hour) and then trooped off into the small chamber  beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until  called for their practical examination.
Students who had already been  tested did not return afterward, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  had no idea how <PER>Hermione</PER> had done.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called,  “Parkinson, Pansy — Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati —  Potter, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Good luck,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly.
He  pointed <PER>Harry</PER> toward what looked like the very oldest  and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small  table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor  Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“The famous Potter?”   Out of the corner of his eye, <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw  <PER>Malfoy</PER> throw a scathing look over at him; the wine  glass <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been levitating fell to the floor and  smashed.
“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need  to be nervous... Now, if I could ask you to take this  eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me...”   On the whole <PER>Harry</PER> thought it went rather well; his  Levitation Charm was certainly much better than  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s had been, though he wished he had not  mixed up the incantations for Color- Change and  Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to  be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size  of a badger before <PER>Harry</PER> could rectify his mistake.
He  could tell <PER>Ron</PER>, though; <PER>Ron</PER> had caused a dinner plate  to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea  how it had happened.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining  <PER>Harry</PER> again, when <PER>Harry</PER> demonstrated a perfect  boggart banishing spell.
On Friday, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had a day off while  <PER>Hermione</PER> sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they  had the whole weekend in front of them, they  permitted themselves a break from studying.
<PER>Harry</PER>  could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the distance, teaching a class on  the edge of the forest.
“It  means ‘partnership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mixed it up with  ‘eihwaz.’ ”   “Ah well,” said <PER>Ron</PER> lazily, “that’s only one mistake,  isn’t it, you’ll still get — ”       “Oh shut up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, “it could be the  one mistake that makes the difference between a pass  and a fail.
And what’s more, someone’s put another  niffler in Umbridge’s office, I don’t know how they got  it through that new door, but I just walked past there  and Umbridge is shrieking her head off — by the  sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg — ”   “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
And we do not want  <PER>Hagrid</PER> chucked out!”   “He’s teaching at the moment, she can’t blame him,”  said <PER>Harry</PER>, gesturing out of the window.
“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, <PER>Harry</PER>, you really  think Umbridge will wait for proof?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  who seemed determined to be in a towering temper,  and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories,  banging the door behind her.
“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, very  quietly, prodding his queen forward so that she could  begin beating up one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s knights.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s bad mood persisted for most of the  weekend, though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> found it quite easy  to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday  studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to which  <PER>Harry</PER> was looking forward least and which he was  sure would be the one that would be the downfall of  his ambitions to become an Auror.
<PER>Neville</PER>,  who was sitting very near <PER>Harry</PER>, also looked happier  than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him during a Potions class.
<PER>Harry</PER> was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s  Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let  <PER>Hagrid</PER> down.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> watching anxiously out of his  cabin window.
When <PER>Harry</PER>’s examiner, a plump little  witch this time, smiled at him and told him he could  leave, <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Hagrid</PER> a fleeting thumbs-up before  heading back up to the castle.
“No more pretending we care what  happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly ...”   “And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell  die, <PER>Ron</PER>, die — I’m just chucking them in the bin  where they belong.”   <PER>Harry</PER> laughed just as <PER>Hermione</PER> came running up  behind them.
“Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy,” she  said, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both sighed with relief.
He glanced around to see  whether <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> had noticed what he had,  but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him  at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though  he was sneaking looks at anyone else’s work, he  hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be  adding notes to it while really peering over the top of  the parapet toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
Several of the  people around <PER>Harry</PER> ducked out from behind their  telescopes and peered instead in the direction of  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was gazing transfixed at  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped and returned at once to her star  chart; <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at his own and noticed that         he had mislabelled Venus as Mars.
Cries and yells echoed  across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable,  <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” and <PER>Hagrid</PER> roared, “Reasonable be damned,  yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!”   <PER>Harry</PER> could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting  to defend <PER>Hagrid</PER>, leaping at the wizards surrounding  him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to  the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, both hands over her mouth;  <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER> and saw that he too was  looking scared.
“How  dare you!”   “It’s <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him double over  and thought for a moment that he had finally been  overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next  moment <PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing again with what  appeared to be a sack on his back — then <PER>Harry</PER>  realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around his  shoulders.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had turned and  begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck;  Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him but  it missed, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, running full-pelt toward the  distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
When it  came at last he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> forced their  telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and  dashed back down the spiral staircase.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> did well, didn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked  more alarmed than impressed.
“At least they didn’t get to take <PER>Hagrid</PER> off to  Azkaban,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I ’spect he’s gone to join  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, hasn’t he?”   “I suppose so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked tearful.
“Oh, this is awful, I really thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would  be back before long, but now we’ve lost <PER>Hagrid</PER> too...”   They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to  find it full.
Seamus and Dean, who had arrived  ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, were now telling  everyone what they had heard from the top of the  Astronomy Tower.
“She was  always going to try and get <PER>Hagrid</PER> out.”   “And she thought <PER>Hagrid</PER> was putting nifflers in her  office,” piped up Katie Bell.
“He was  too close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “That’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sinking into an armchair  beside <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt wide awake — the image of  <PER>Hagrid</PER> sprinting away into the dark was haunting  him.
<PER>Harry</PER> would very much  have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he  had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-  minute studying, so instead he sat with his head in  his hands by the common room window, trying hard  not to doze off as he read through some of the notes  stacked three-and-a-half feet high that <PER>Hermione</PER> had  lent him.
Then tomorrow, he and <PER>Ron</PER> were going to go down to  the Quidditch pitch — he was going to have a fly on  <PER>Ron</PER>’s broom and savor their freedom from studying...   “Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks  from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant  hourglass.
“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”   “I need to see Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” gasped <PER>Harry</PER>,  the breath tearing his lungs.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gone,  <PER>Hagrid</PER> had gone, but he had always expected  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to be there, irascible and         inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly  present...   “I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam  Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face.
He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the  teeming corridor where he stood, buffeted by the  crowd, the panic expanding inside him like poison gas  so that his head swam and he could not think what to  do...   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, said a voice in his head.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, looking very  frightened.
“Come on, I’ve  got to tell you something...”   He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering  through doorways, and at last found an empty  classroom into which he dived, closing the door       behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the moment they were  inside and leaning against it, facing them.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “G-get  there?”   “Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue  Sirius!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly.
“But — <PER>Harry</PER> ...” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rather frightened voice,   “er .
how did <PER>Voldemort</PER> get into the Ministry  of Magic without anybody realizing he was there?”   “How do I know?” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The question is  how we’re going to get in there!”   “But ... <PER>Harry</PER>, think about this,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  taking a step toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the  afternoon...
they’re probably the  two most wanted wizards in the world... You think  they could get into a building full of Aurors  undetected?”   “I dunno, <PER>Voldemort</PER> used an Invisibility Cloak or  something!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“Anyway, the Department  of Mysteries has always been completely empty  whenever I’ve been — ”   “You’ve never been there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  quietly.
“How d’you explain  <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad then, what was all that about, how come I  knew what had happened to him?”   “He’s got a point,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly, looking at  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, how on earth could <PER>Voldemort</PER>       have got hold of Sirius when he’s been in Grimmauld  Place all the time?”   “Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh  air,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding worried.
“He’s been  desperate to get out of that house for ages — ”   “But why,” <PER>Hermione</PER> persisted, “why on earth would  <PER>Voldemort</PER> want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or  whatever the thing is?”   “I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!” <PER>Harry</PER>  yelled at her.
“Maybe Sirius is just someone  <PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t care about seeing hurt — ”   “You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> in a hushed voice.
Maybe he told Sirius the secret of  how to get the weapon!”   “Yeah — and that’s why <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been so keen  to keep Sirius locked up all the time!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Look, I’m sorry,” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but neither of you  are making sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of  this, no proof <PER>Voldemort</PER> and Sirius are even there — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s seen them!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, rounding  on her.
I mean, it was really great of you and everything,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, looking positively petrified at  the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“Everyone thought it was a  wonderful thing to do — ”   “That’s funny,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a trembling voice,  “because I definitely remember <PER>Ron</PER> saying I’d wasted  time acting the hero... Is that what you think this is?
“I’m trying to say — <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows you, <PER>Harry</PER>!
What if he’s just trying to get you into the  Department of Myst — ?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me  there or not — they’ve taken <PER>McGonagall</PER> to St.  Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone left from the Order at         Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don’t go, Sirius is  dead!”     “But <PER>Harry</PER> — what if your dream was — was just  that, a dream?”   <PER>Harry</PER> let out a roar of frustration.
Because they’re REAL, <PER>Hermione</PER> — Sirius is  trapped — I’ve seen him — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got him, and  no one else knows, and that means we’re the only  ones who can save him, and if you don’t want to do it,  fine, but I’m going, understand?
And if I remember  rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving -  people-thing when it was you I was saving from the  dementors, or” — he rounded on <PER>Ron</PER> — “when it was  your sister I was saving from the basilisk — ”   “I never said I had a problem!” said <PER>Ron</PER> heatedly.
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve just said it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  fiercely.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around.
“We recognized <PER>Harry</PER>’s  voice — what are you yelling about?”   “Never you mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER> roughly.
“Wait ... <PER>Harry</PER>, they  can help.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“Listen,” she said urgently, “<PER>Harry</PER>, we need to  establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters     “I’ve told you, I saw — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m begging you, please!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  desperately.
“We  haven’t got time to waste — ”   “But if this is a trick of V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s — <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve  got to check, we’ve got to — ”   “How?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded.
“Well draw Umbridge away  again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where we  can use <PER>Ginny</PER> and Luna.”   Though clearly struggling to understand what was  going on, <PER>Ginny</PER> said immediately, “Yeah, well do it,”  and Luna said, “When you say ‘Sirius,’ are you  talking about Stubby Boardman?”   Nobody answered her.
“Okay,” <PER>Harry</PER> said aggressively to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Okay, if  you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with  you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of  Mysteries right now — ”   “The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking  mildly surprised.
“Now, we need to keep students away from  her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin’s  bound to go and tip her off...”   “Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,”  said <PER>Ginny</PER> promptly, “and warn people not to go  down there because someone’s let off a load of  Garroting Gas.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked surprised at the  readiness with which <PER>Ginny</PER> had come up with this  lie.
<PER>Ginny</PER> shrugged and said, “Fred and George were  planning to do it before they left.”   “Okay,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “well then, <PER>Harry</PER>, you and I  will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak  into the office and you can talk to Sirius — ”   “He’s not there, <PER>Hermione</PER>!”   “I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at  home or not while I keep watch, I don’t think you  should be in there alone, Lee’s already proved the  window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers through  it.”       Even through his anger and impatience <PER>Harry</PER>  recognized <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s offer to accompany him into  Umbridge’s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.
“Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think  we’re going to be able to bank on more than five  minutes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved that <PER>Harry</PER>  seemed to have accepted the plan, “not with Filch and  the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.”   “Five minutes’ll be enough,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some  firewhisky...”   But <PER>Harry</PER> was already tearing away back along the  corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping  the last few stairs to join <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and  Luna, who were huddled together at the end of  Umbridge’s corridor.
“So <PER>Ron</PER> — you go and head  Umbridge off... <PER>Ginny</PER>, Luna, if you can start moving  people out of the corridor.
<PER>Harry</PER> and I will get the  cloak on and wait until the coast is clear...”   <PER>Ron</PER> strode away, his bright red hair visible right to  the end of the passage.
“Get over here,” muttered <PER>Hermione</PER>, tugging at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist and pulling him back into a recess  where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood  muttering to itself on a column.
When at last the  surrounding area was quite clear, <PER>Hermione</PER> said  quietly, “I think that’s as good as we’re going to get,  <PER>Harry</PER> — come on, let’s do it.”   Together they moved forward, covered by the cloak.
As they passed <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>  whispered, “Good one ... don’t forget the signal ...”   “What’s the signal?” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, as they  approached Umbridge’s door.
“A loud chorus of Weasley Is Our King’ if they see  Umbridge coming,” replied <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER>  inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in the crack  between door and wall.
“Hers too ...”         <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that  <PER>Hermione</PER> had just had her wand wrested from her as  well.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was leaning on the windowsill,  smirking as he threw <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand into the air one-  handed and then caught it again.
There was a commotion outside and several large  Slytherins entered, each gripping <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Luna,  and — to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bewilderment — <PER>Neville</PER>, who was  trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in  imminent danger of suffocation.
“ That one.” he poked a thick  finger at <PER>Neville</PER>, “tried to stop me taking her,” he  pointed at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was trying to kick the shins of  the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him  along too.”         “Good, good,” said Umbridge, watching <PER>Ginny</PER>’s  struggles.
“You stationed lookouts around  my office and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> laughed even louder, “to tell me the  poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration  department when I knew perfectly well that he was  busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school  telescopes, Mr. Filch having just informed me so.
I doubt it was Minerva <PER>McGonagall</PER>, I  hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone...”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> and a few of the other members of the  Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> — fetch  Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> stowed <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand inside his robes and left  the room smirking, but <PER>Harry</PER> hardly noticed.
<PER>Neville</PER> was turning steadily more purple in the  face while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off  her.
He kept his face deliberately smooth and  blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside  and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> came back into the room, holding  open the door for <PER>Snape</PER>.
I have  just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a  person or persons unknown!”   “Really?” said <PER>Snape</PER>, showing his first, faint sign of  interest as he looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Potter has never shown much  inclination to follow school rules.”   His cold, dark eyes were boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s, who met  his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he  had seen in his dream, willing <PER>Snape</PER> to read it in his  mind, to understand .
“I wish to interrogate him!” shouted Umbridge angrily,  and <PER>Snape</PER> looked away from <PER>Harry</PER> back into her  furiously quivering face.
The only trouble is that most  venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for  truth-telling...”         <PER>Snape</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>, who stared at him,  frantic to communicate without words.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Sirius —   “You are on probation!” shrieked Professor Umbridge,  and <PER>Snape</PER> looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly  raised.
“Padfoot?” cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly  from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Snape</PER>.
What does he mean, <PER>Snape</PER>?”   <PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
And Crabbe, loosen your hold a  little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of  tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to  mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a  job.”         He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving  <PER>Harry</PER> in a state of worse turmoil than before: <PER>Snape</PER>  had been his very last hope.
“No — <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>,  well have to tell her!”   “No way!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at the little of  <PER>Hermione</PER> he could see.
“We’ll have to, <PER>Harry</PER>, shell force it out of you anyway,  what’s ... what’s the point... ?”   And <PER>Hermione</PER> began to cry weakly into the back of  Millicent Bulstrode ’s robes.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was staring at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though she had  never seen her before; <PER>Neville</PER>, still choking for breath,  was gazing at her too.
Though <PER>Hermione</PER> was sobbing  desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a  tear...   “I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Now  then ... with whom was Potter communicating just  now?”   “Well,” gulped <PER>Hermione</PER> into her hands, “well, he was  trying to speak to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>...”   <PER>Ron</PER> froze, his eyes wide; <PER>Ginny</PER> stopped trying to  stamp on her Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna  looked mildly surprised.
“You know  where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is, then?”   “Well ... no!” sobbed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But — but we needed to tell him something  important!” wailed <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding her hands more  tightly over her face, not, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, out of anguish,  but to disguise the continued absence of tears.
On Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders, of course?”   “Y-y-yes,” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Get up, now — ”   “Professor,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> eagerly, “Professor Umbridge,   I think some of the squad should come with you to  look after — ”   “I am a fully qualified Ministry official, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, do you  really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers  alone?” asked Umbridge sharply.
You will remain here until  I return and make sure none of these” — she gestured  around at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna — “escape.”         “All right,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, looking sulky and  disappointed.
“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the  way,” said Umbridge, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  with her wand.
“Lead on...”           FIGHT AND FLIGHT   <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what <PER>Hermione</PER> was planning, or  even whether she had a plan.
It seemed incredible to <PER>Harry</PER> that  twenty feet away were people who were enjoying  dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the  world...   <PER>Hermione</PER> walked straight out of the oak front doors  and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air.
“It’s hidden in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, is it?” said Umbridge  eagerly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
His scar was  throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet  burned white-hot, as he knew it would if <PER>Voldemort</PER>  had moved in for the kill...   “Then ... where is it?” asked Umbridge, with a hint of  uncertainty in her voice as <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to  stride toward the forest.
“The Ministry  places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I’m  afraid.”       As they reached the cool shade of the first trees,   <PER>Harry</PER> tried to catch <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eye; walking into the  forest without wands seemed to him to be more  foolhardy than anything they had done so far this  evening.
Neither of  them paused to help her up again; <PER>Hermione</PER> merely  strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit  further in!”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, keep your voice down,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered,  hurrying to catch up with her.
Around  fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows  raised and loaded, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center of the  clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of  terror.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your own —     “What are you doing in our forest?” bellowed the  hard-faced gray centaur whom <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  had seen on their last trip into the forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> and pulled her to the  ground.
“Now!” roared a voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear and a thick hairy  arm descended from thin air and dragged him  upright; <PER>Hermione</PER> too had been pulled to her feet.
“We do not attack foals.”   “They brought her here, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” replied the centaur  who had such a firm grip on <PER>Harry</PER>.
We only came in here because we  hoped you’d drive her off for us — ”         <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once from the look on the face of the  gray centaur holding <PER>Hermione</PER> that she had made a  terrible mistake in saying this.
“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur  holding <PER>Harry</PER>, tightening his grip and rearing a little  at the same time, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet left the ground  momentarily.
We do not  recognize your laws, we do not acknowledge your  superiority, we are — ”   But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at  that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge  of the clearing so loud that all of them — <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the  clearing — looked around.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s centaur let him fall  to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and  quiver of arrows; <PER>Hermione</PER> had been dropped too,  and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried toward her as two thick tree  trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of  Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.
“Hagger.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what “hagger” meant, or what  language it was from, nor did he much care — he was       watching Grawp ’s feet, which were almost as long as  <PER>Harry</PER>’s whole body.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Hermione</PER> shaking as Grawp opened  his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling  voice, “Hermy.”   “Goodness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so  tightly it was growing numb and looking as though  she was about to faint, “he — he remembered!”   “HERMY!” roared Grawp.
Pebble-sized  droplets of Grawp’s blood showered <PER>Harry</PER> as he  pulled <PER>Hermione</PER> to her feet and the pair of them ran  as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees.
As  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched, Grawp gave another  roar of fury and plunged after them, smashing more  trees aside as he went.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved instinctively together,  peering through the trees, as <PER>Ron</PER> came into sight,  with <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna hurrying along behind  him.
All of them looked a little the worse for wear —  there were several long scratches running the length  of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling      above <PER>Neville</PER>’s right eye, <PER>Ron</PER>’s lip was bleeding worse  than ever — but all were looking rather pleased with  themselves.
“So,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing aside a low-hanging branch  and holding out <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, “had any ideas?”   “How did you get away?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement,  taking his wand from <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, <PER>Neville</PER>  brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> airily, now handing back <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand too.
“But <PER>Ginny</PER> was best, she got <PER>Malfoy</PER> — Bat-Bogey Hex  — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the  great flapping things.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s little brother,” said <PER>Ron</PER> promptly.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, rounding on her, “first of  all, “we’ aren’t doing anything if you’re including  yourself in that, and second of all, <PER>Ron</PER>’s the only one  with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by a  security troll, so — ”   “I’ve got a broom!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes met <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
in addition to himself, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> to join him in the attempt to rescue  Sirius, he would not have picked <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, or  Luna.
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna  in a dignified voice, “but they can, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> says  they’re very good at finding places their riders are  looking for.”   <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around.
“Is it those mad horse things?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly,  staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral  <PER>Harry</PER> was patting.
“Four, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, scowling.
“Look, you three” — he pointed at <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and  Luna — “you’re not involved in this, you’re not — ”   They burst into more protests.
“But  unless we can find more thestrals you’re not going to  be able — ”   “Oh, more of them will come,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> confidently,  who like <PER>Ron</PER> was squinting in quite the wrong  direction, apparently under the impression that she  was looking at the horses.
“What makes you think that?”   “Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and  <PER>Hermione</PER> are both covered in blood,” she said coolly,  “and we know <PER>Hagrid</PER> lures thestrals with raw meat,  so that’s probably why these two turned up in the  first place...”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and  looked down to see the closest thestral licking his  sleeve, which was damp with Grawp’s blood.
“<PER>Ron</PER>  and I will take these two and go ahead, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  can stay here with you three and she’ll attract more  thestrals — ”   “I’m not staying behind!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> furiously.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, however,  were still standing motionless on the spot,  openmouthed and staring.
“When we can’t see the things?”      “Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding obligingly from her  thestral and marching over to him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
In the falling darkness <PER>Harry</PER> saw  small collections of lights as they passed over more  villages, then a winding road on which a single car  was beetling its way home through the hills...   “This is bizarre!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> yell from  somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must  feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible  means of support...
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew for sure was that Sirius  had neither done as <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted, nor died, for  he was convinced that either outcome would cause  him to feel <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s jubilation or fury course  through his own body, making his scar sear as  painfully as it had on the night Mr. Weasley was  attacked...         On they flew through the gathering darkness; <PER>Harry</PER>’s  face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping  the thestral’s sides so tightly, but he did not dare  shift positions lest he slip...
If <PER>Voldemort</PER> decided Sirius was not going to crack ...  I’d know...   <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach gave a jolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped the thestral with every last  ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact,  but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a  shadow and <PER>Harry</PER> slid from his back, looking around  at the street where the overflowing dumpster still  stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box,      both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the  streetlights.
“Never, ever again ... that was  the worst — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> touched down on either side of  him.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> marched in obediently; <PER>Hermione</PER>,  <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna squashed themselves in after them;  <PER>Harry</PER> took one glance back at the thestrals, now  foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster,  then forced himself into the box after Luna.
Please state your name and business.”   “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger,”   <PER>Harry</PER> said very quickly, “<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, <PER>Neville</PER>  Longbottom, Luna Lovegood ... We’re here to save  someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!”   “Thank you,” said the cool female voice.
<PER>Hermione</PER> scooped  them up and handed them mutely to <PER>Harry</PER> over  <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.
The door of the telephone box burst open; <PER>Harry</PER>  toppled out of it, followed by <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna.
“Come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly and the six of them  sprinted off down the hall, <PER>Harry</PER> in the lead, past the  fountain, toward the desk where the security man  who had weighed <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had sat and which  was now deserted.
“You  could be miles away.”   “We’re coming with you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm as though frightened  the floor might move too, but it did not.
“We  won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius — ”   “Don’t go calling for him, though!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said  urgently, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never needed her advice less;  his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the  time being.
“Where do we go, then, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
“This isn’t right, <PER>Harry</PER>, come on, let’s go...”   She sounded scared, much more scared than she had  in the room where the brains swam, yet <PER>Harry</PER>  thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it,  old though it was.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s go, okay?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> more forcefully.
“Nobody’s talking, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now moving  over to him.
“Is that you, <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “I’m here, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, appearing around the side  of the archway.
On the other side, <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>  were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too.
Without speaking, <PER>Hermione</PER> took hold of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s  arm, <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Neville</PER>’s, and they marched them firmly  back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the  way back up to the door.
“What d’you reckon that arch was?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked  <PER>Hermione</PER> as they regained the dark circular room.
“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, joining  <PER>Harry</PER> in the attempt to force the door open.
“It can’t be, <PER>Harry</PER> could get through all the doors in  his dream,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, marking the door with  another fiery cross as <PER>Harry</PER> replaced the now-useless  handle of Sirius’s knife in his pocket.
“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  under her breath, and <PER>Neville</PER> gave a nervous little  laugh.
“Keep going!” said <PER>Harry</PER> sharply, because <PER>Ginny</PER>  showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg’s  progress back into a bird.
“Anywhere  here ... really close ...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, but he did not  want to respond.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> called.
“What?”   He did not want to hear what <PER>Ron</PER> had to say, did not  want to hear <PER>Ron</PER> tell him he had been stupid, or  suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but eagerly this time — it had to  be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue — he  strode back to where they were all standing, a little  way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except  <PER>Ron</PER> staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the  shelves.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter   <PER>Harry</PER> stared at it.
“None of  the rest of us are here...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think you should touch it,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, as he stretched out his hand.
“It’s something to do with me,  isn’t it?”   “Don’t, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> suddenly.
A harsh female  voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to <PER>Harry</PER>’s  left said triumphantly, “The Dark Lord always  knows!”        “Always,” echoed <PER>Malfoy</PER> softly.
She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that  they were mere feet away from <PER>Harry</PER> and the others,  the light from their wands dazzling <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> stir beside him.
As he did so, the five wands of <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna rose on either  side of him.
I’ll  do it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt the others close in around <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“You jest, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”     “Nope, not jesting,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his eyes flicking from  Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a  space through which they could escape.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you that the reason you bear  that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department  of Mysteries?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneeringly.
“Can this be?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sounding maliciously  delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing  again, and under cover of their laughter, <PER>Harry</PER> hissed  to <PER>Hermione</PER>, moving his lips as little as possible,  “Smash shelves — ”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> repeated.
“Because the only people who are permitted to  retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries,  Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the       Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use  others to steal it for him.”   “And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?”   “About both of you, Potter, about both of you ...  Haven’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to  kill you as a baby?”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the slitted eyeholes through which  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gray eyes were gleaming.
“Someone made a prophecy about <PER>Voldemort</PER> and  me?” he said quietly, gazing at Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his  fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his  hand.
The  towering structure swayed as a hundred glass  spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled  into the air and floated there, their voices echoing  from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent  of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining  down upon the floor —   “RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and as the shelves swayed  precariously and more glass spheres began to pour  from above, he seized a handful of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s robes  and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as  chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down  upon them.
They were all yelling, there were cries of  pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed  upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the  Seers unleashed from their spheres —   <PER>Harry</PER> found the way ahead clear and saw <PER>Ron</PER>,   <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over  their heads.
He could  hear footsteps right behind him and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice  urging <PER>Neville</PER> on.
The door through which they had  come was ajar straight ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the  glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the  prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand,  waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold  before slamming the door behind them —       “ Colloportus\” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER> and the door sealed  itself with an odd squelching noise.
He had thought that <PER>Ron</PER>, Luna, and <PER>Ginny</PER> had been  ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this  room, but there was nobody there.
<PER>Harry</PER> put his ear close to the  door to listen and heard Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> roar: “Leave  Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for  Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy —  Jugson, come back here, we need to organize!
Well  split into pairs and search, and don’t forget, be gentle  with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you can kill  the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you  take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson,  Dolohov, the door straight ahead — Macnair and  Avery, through here — Rookwood, over there —  Mulciber, come with me!”   “What do we do?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, trembling  from head to foot.
They were almost there       when <PER>Harry</PER> heard something large and heavy collide  with the door <PER>Hermione</PER> had charmed shut.
“Alohomora\”   As the door flew open, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>  dived under desks.
The second Death Eater, however, had leapt  aside to avoid <PER>Harry</PER>’s spell and now pointed his own  wand at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had crawled out from under  the desk to get a better aim.
<PER>Neville</PER> overturned his  desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly  at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS\”   Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of  their hands and soared back toward the entrance to  the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and  charged after them, the Death Eater in front and         <PER>Harry</PER> hot on his heels, <PER>Neville</PER> bringing up the rear,  plainly horrors truck at what he had done.
“Get out of the way, <PER>Harry</PER>!” yelled <PER>Neville</PER>, clearly  determined to repair the damage.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung himself sideways as <PER>Neville</PER> took aim  again and shouted, “ STUPEFY !”   The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s  shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall  full of variously shaped hourglasses.
<PER>Harry</PER>  ducked down behind another desk as the man turned  — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he  ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “STUP —     “STUPEFY]” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had just caught  up with them.
LUNA?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised his wand but to his  amazement <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his arm.
With  a cry of triumph, both yelled, “ IMPEDIMENT A\”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> were all knocked  backward off their feet.
<PER>Neville</PER> was thrown over the  desk and disappeared from view, <PER>Hermione</PER> smashed  into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a  cascade of heavy books; the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head  slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights  burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was  too dizzy and bewildered to react.
“WEVE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest  <PER>Harry</PER>, “IN AN OFFICE OFF — ”       “ Silenciol ” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the man’s voice was  extinguished.
“HERMIONE!”   <PER>Harry</PER> fell to his knees beside her as <PER>Neville</PER> crawled  rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand  held up in front of him.
The Death Eater kicked out  hard at <PER>Neville</PER>’s head as he emerged — his foot broke  <PER>Neville</PER>’s wand in two and connected with his face —  <PER>Neville</PER> gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his  mouth and nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> twisted around, his own wand  held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped  off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at  <PER>Harry</PER>, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face  from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard  who had murdered the Prewetts.
With his free hand, he pointed from  the prophecy still clutched in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, to  himself, then at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be  dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead...   “Whaddever you do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> fiercely from  under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly  broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and  chin, “don’d gib it to him!”   Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov  looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death  Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling,  his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything  around him.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said at once, shaking her as the  baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight  again.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, wake up...”   “Whaddid he do to her?” said <PER>Neville</PER>, crawling out  from under the desk again to kneel at her other side,  blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose.
“I  dunno...”   <PER>Neville</PER> groped for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wrist.
“Dat’s a pulse, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’b sure id is...”     Such a powerful wave of relief swept through <PER>Harry</PER>  that for a moment he felt light-headed.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, we’re not far from the exit,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
If we can just  get you across it and find the right door before any  more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet you can get  <PER>Hermione</PER> up the corridor and into the lift... Then you  could find someone... Raise the alarm ...”   “And whad are you going do do?” said <PER>Neville</PER>,  mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and  frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> — ”   “We’ll dake her wid us,” said <PER>Neville</PER> firmly.
“I’ll carry  her — you’re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab — ”   He stood up and seized one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms,  glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who hesitated, then grabbed the  other and helped hoist <PER>Hermione</PER>’s limp form over  <PER>Neville</PER>’s shoulders.
“Wait,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, snatching up <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand  from the floor and shoving it into <PER>Neville</PER>s hand,   “you’d better take this...”   <PER>Neville</PER> kicked aside the broken fragments of his own  wand as they walked slowly toward the door.
“My gran’s going do kill be,” said <PER>Neville</PER> thickly, blood  spattering from his nose as he spoke, “dat was by  dad’s old wand...”   <PER>Harry</PER> stuck his head out of the door and looked  around cautiously.
They walked a few steps forward, <PER>Neville</PER>  tottering slightly due to <PER>Hermione</PER>’s weight.
With a sinking heart  <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER>’s fiery crosses had faded  from the doors.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” croaked <PER>Harry</PER>, dashing toward them.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>  — are you all — ?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, giggling weakly, lurching forward,  seizing the front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes and gazing at him  with unfocused eyes.
“There you are... Ha ha ha ...  You look funny, <PER>Harry</PER>... You’re all messed up...   <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was very white and something dark was  trickling from the corner of his mouth.
Next moment  his knees had given way, but he still clutched the  front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was pulled into a  kind of bow.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said fearfully.
“Four of them chased us  into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd  place, some of the time we were just floating in the  dark — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, we saw Uranus up close!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still  giggling feebly.
“Anyway, one of them grabbed <PER>Ginny</PER>’s foot, I used the  Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ...”   Luna gestured hopelessly at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was  breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.
“And what about <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> fearfully, as <PER>Ron</PER>  continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of  <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna  sadly, “but he’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get  him along at all...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear down to his  mouth and still giggling weakly, “you know who this  girl is, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Luna, can you help <PER>Ginny</PER>?”   “Yes,” said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for  safekeeping, putting an arm around <PER>Ginny</PER>’s waist  and pulling her up.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled  <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months  ago, he had pulled <PER>Dudley</PER>’s.
Stunning Spells shot across the room: <PER>Harry</PER> smashed  his way through the door ahead, flung <PER>Ron</PER>  unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help  <PER>Neville</PER> in with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Luna — <PER>Neville</PER> — help me!”   The three of them tore around the room, sealing the  doors as they went: <PER>Harry</PER> crashed into a table and  rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next  door.
Luna   and <PER>Neville</PER> were bewitching the doors along the   opposite wall — then, as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the very top of   the room, he heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh  ??
He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he  was safe as long as they thought they might hit the  prophecy —   “Hey!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had staggered to his feet and  was now tottering drunkenly toward <PER>Harry</PER>, giggling.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn’t  that weird, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, get out of the way, get down — ”   But <PER>Ron</PER> had already pointed his wand at the tank.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>,  and <PER>Neville</PER> and each of the Death Eaters turned in  spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a  brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish.
For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it  soared toward <PER>Ron</PER>, spinning as it came, and what  looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it,  unraveling like rolls of film —   “Ha ha ha, <PER>Harry</PER>, look at it — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching it  disgorge its gaudy innards.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come and touch  it, bet it’s weird — ”   “RON, NO!”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what would happen if <PER>Ron</PER>  touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind  the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything  good.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it  — no, stop — stop — ”   But the thin ribbons were spinning around <PER>Ron</PER>’s  chest now.
“Diffindol” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sever the feelers  wrapping themselves tightly around <PER>Ron</PER> before his  eyes, but they would not break.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed <PER>Ginny</PER>,  immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor — then  a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater’s  wands and hit her squarely in the face.
“ STUBEFYl” shouted <PER>Neville</PER>, wheeling around and  waving <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand at the oncoming Death  Eaters.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were now the only  two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom  sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that  left craters in the wall behind them.
Inwardly praying that <PER>Neville</PER> would stay with  <PER>Ron</PER> — find some way of releasing him — he ran a few  feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish —   He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone  step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash  that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed  flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone  archway stood on its dais.
<PER>Neville</PER> was scrambling down the  stone benches toward them, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand held  fast in his trembling hand.
“<PER>Neville</PER> — no — go back to <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “STUBEFYl” <PER>Neville</PER> shouted again, pointing his wand  at each Death Eater in turn, “STUBEFYl.
She looked transported,  alive with excitement as she glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then  back at <PER>Neville</PER>.
The Death Eaters  were completely distracted by the appearance of the  members of the Order, who were now raining spells  down upon them as they jumped from step to step  toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies,  the flashes of light, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Neville</PER> crawling  along.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain  when I left — ”   The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit  it, leaving a crater right where <PER>Neville</PER>’s hand had  been seconds before.
He turned his wand backward toward the  man’s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation,  and the man’s free hand was groping toward the hand  in which <PER>Harry</PER> was grasping the prophecy —   “AARGH!”   <PER>Neville</PER> had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to  articulate a spell, he had jabbed <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand  hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater’s mask.
The  man relinquished <PER>Harry</PER> at once with a howl of pain  and <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around to face him and gasped,  “STUPEFY]”       The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask  slipped off.
“Thanks!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Neville</PER>, pulling him aside as  Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so  fiercely that their wands were blurs.
Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the  head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted  with glee.
“Now, Potter — ”   He made the same slashing movement with his wand  that he had used on <PER>Hermione</PER> just as <PER>Harry</PER> yelled,  “Protego\”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt something streak across his face like a  blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways,  and he fell over <PER>Neville</PER>’s jerking legs, but the Shield  Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
Now Sirius and  Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like  swords, sparks flying from their wand tips —       Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same  slashing movement he had used on <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, take the prophecy, grab <PER>Neville</PER>, and run!”  Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not  see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his  field of vision, battling with the pockmarked  Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light  flew over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head as he launched himself toward  <PER>Neville</PER> —   “Can you stand?” he bellowed in <PER>Neville</PER>’s ear, as  <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably.
“Put  your arm round my neck — ”   <PER>Neville</PER> did so — <PER>Harry</PER> heaved — <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs were  still flying in every direction, they would not support  him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them.
Both fell backward, <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs waving wildly like an  overturned beetle’s, <PER>Harry</PER> with his left arm held up in  the air to try and save the small glass ball from being  smashed.
“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled  Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice in his ear, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the tip  of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand pressing hard between his ribs.
“No — get — off — me ... <PER>Neville</PER> — catch it!”   <PER>Harry</PER> flung the prophecy across the floor, <PER>Neville</PER>  spun himself around on his back and scooped the  ball to his chest.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed the wand instead at  <PER>Neville</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed his own wand back over his  shoulder and yelled, “Impedimental”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> was blasted off his back.
As <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled  up again he looked around and saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> smash  into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now  dueling.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> aimed his wand at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>  again, but before he could draw breath to strike,  Lupin had jumped between them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, round up the others and GO!”   <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Neville</PER> by the shoulder of his robes and  lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps.
<PER>Harry</PER> heaved again with all the  strength he possessed and they climbed another step     A spell hit the stone bench at <PER>Harry</PER>’s heel.
“Come on!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, hauling at  <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes.
“Just try and push with your legs — ”   He gave another stupendous heave and <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes  tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass  ball dropped from his pocket and before either of       them could catch it, one of <PER>Neville</PER>’s floundering feet  kicked it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’b sorry!” cried <PER>Neville</PER>, his face anguished as  his legs continued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, I  didn’d bean do — ■”   “It doesn’t matter!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“Just try and  stand, let’s get out of — ”   “ Dubbledorel” said <PER>Neville</PER>, his sweaty face suddenly  transported, staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“What?”   “DUBBLEDORE!”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned to look where <PER>Neville</PER> was staring.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sped down the steps past <PER>Neville</PER> and  <PER>Harry</PER>, who had no more thought of leaving.
<PER>Harry</PER> released <PER>Neville</PER>, though he was unaware of  doing so.
“There’s nothing you can do, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!”   “It’s too late, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “We can still reach him — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would  not let go...   “There’s nothing you can do, <PER>Harry</PER> ... nothing... He’s  gone.”           THE ONLY ONE HE EVER FEARED   “He hasn’t gone!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
He did not believe it, he would not believe it; still he  fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had: Lupin  did not understand, people hid behind that curtain,  he had heard them whispering the first time he had  entered the room — Sirius was hiding, simply lurking  out of sight —   “SIRIUS!” he bellowed, “SIRIUS!”   “He can’t come back, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lupin, his voice  breaking as he struggled to contain <PER>Harry</PER>.
To <PER>Harry</PER> it was  meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past  them did not matter, nothing mattered except that  Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing     feet from them behind that old curtain, was not going  to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair  and eager to reenter the battle —   Lupin dragged <PER>Harry</PER> away from the dais, <PER>Harry</PER> still  staring at the archway, angry at Sirius now for  keeping him waiting —   But some part of him realized, even as he fought to  break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him  waiting before... Sirius had risked everything, always,  to see <PER>Harry</PER>, to help him...
“<PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Neville</PER> had slid down the stone benches one by one to  the place where <PER>Harry</PER> stood.
“<PER>Harry</PER> ... I’b really sorry...” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
She was halfway up the steps  now —   “<PER>Harry</PER> — no!” cried Lupin, but <PER>Harry</PER> had already  ripped his arm from Lupin’s slackened grip.
He leapt over Luna,      who was groaning on the floor, past <PER>Ginny</PER>, who said,  “<PER>Harry</PER> — what — ?” past <PER>Ron</PER>, who giggled feebly, and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was still unconscious.
I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!”   “I am!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, and a score of ghostly <PER>Harry</PER>’s  seemed to chorus I am\ I am\ I am\ all around the  room.
Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike  face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes  staring ... Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had appeared in the middle  of the hall, his wand pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> who stood  frozen, quite unable to move.
“So you smashed my prophecy?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>  softly, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with those pitiless red eyes.
and my Death Eaters  have let <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thwart me again...”   “Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the  Animagus Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself  down at <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s feet as he paced slowly nearer.
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the  fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth,  and landed on the floor with a crash between <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
And then  he breathed, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked behind him, his heart pounding.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised his wand and sent another jet of  green light at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who turned and was gone  in a whirling of his cloak; next second he had  reappeared behind <PER>Voldemort</PER> and waved his wand  toward the remnants of the fountain; the other  statues sprang to life too.
The  headless statue thrust <PER>Harry</PER> backward, away from  the fight, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> advanced on <PER>Voldemort</PER> and  the golden centaur cantered around them both.
The force of the  spell that emanated from it was such that <PER>Harry</PER>,  though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair  stand on end as it passed, and this time <PER>Voldemort</PER>  was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of  thin air to deflect it.
The spell, whatever it was,  caused no visible damage to the shield, though a  deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly  chilling sound...   “You do not seek to kill me, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” called  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of  the shield.
“Above such brutality, are you?”         “We both know that there are other ways of  destroying a man, Tom,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said calmly,  continuing to walk toward <PER>Voldemort</PER> as though he  had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had  happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall.
“Merely  taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit — ”   “There is nothing worse than death, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”  snarled <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“You are quite wrong,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still closing  in upon <PER>Voldemort</PER> and speaking as lightly as though  they were discussing the matter over drinks.
This time it was the one-armed centaur,  galloping in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that took the blast  and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the  fragments had even hit the floor, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  drawn back his wand and waved it as though  brandishing a whip.
For a moment, it seemed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had won, but  then the fiery rope became a serpent, which  relinquished its hold upon <PER>Voldemort</PER> at once and  turned, hissing furiously, to face <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The snake reared from the floor,  ready to strike —     There was a burst of flame in midair above  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> just as <PER>Voldemort</PER> reappeared, standing       on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so  recently the five statues had stood.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light  had flown at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and  the snake had struck —   Fawkes swooped down in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  opened his beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green  light whole.
At the same moment,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> brandished his wand in one, long, fluid  movement — the snake, which had been an instant  from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air  and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in  the pool rose up and covered <PER>Voldemort</PER> like a cocoon  of molten glass —   For a few seconds <PER>Voldemort</PER> was visible only as a  dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and  indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw  off the suffocating mass —   Then he was gone, and the water fell with a crash  back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides,  drenching the polished floor.
Sure it was over, sure <PER>Voldemort</PER> had decided to flee,  <PER>Harry</PER> made to run out from behind his statue guard,  but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bellowed, “Stay where you are,   <PER>Harry</PER>!”   For the first time, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sounded frightened.
They were fused together, bound by  pain, and there was no escape —   And when the creature spoke, it used <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth,  so that in his agony he felt his jaw move...   “ Kill me now, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>...”   Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for  release, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the creature use him again...   “If death is nothing, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, kill the boy...”   Let the pain stop, thought <PER>Harry</PER>.
Let him kill us... End  it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>... Death is nothing compared to this...   And I’ll see Sirius again...   And as <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart filled with emotion, the  creature’s coils loosened, the pain was gone, <PER>Harry</PER>  was lying facedown on the floor, his glasses gone,  shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood...   And there were voices echoing through the hall, more  voices than there should have been: <PER>Harry</PER> opened his  eyes, saw his glasses lying at the heel of the headless  statue that had been guarding him, but which now  lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking so violently he could not  hold his head up properly.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  pulled him back to his feet, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the tiny gold  statues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a  stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward.
— great heavens above — it  doesn’t seem possible — my word — how can this  be?”   “If you proceed downstairs into the Department of  Mysteries, Cornelius,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, apparently  satisfied that <PER>Harry</PER> was all right, and walking forward  so that the newcomers realized he was there for the  first time (a few of them raised their wands, others  simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and  goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that      his slipper-clad feet left the floor), “you will find  several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death  Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and  awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” gasped Fudge, apparently beside  himself with amazement.
“We can discuss that after I have sent <PER>Harry</PER> back to  Hogwarts,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   Fudge spun around and stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was  still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue         that had been guarding him during <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s duel.
“Why — what’s all this  about?”   “I shall explain everything,” repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  “when <PER>Harry</PER> is back at school.”   He walked away from the pool to the place where the  golden wizard’s head lay on the floor.
“Now see here, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said Fudge, as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> picked up the head and walked back to  <PER>Harry</PER> carrying it.
“Take this Portkey, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   He held out the golden head of the statue, and <PER>Harry</PER>  placed his hand upon it, past caring what he did next  or where he went.
If  he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had not been stupid enough to fall for  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s trick, if he had not been so convinced  that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he  had only opened his mind to the possibility that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had said, banking on  <PER>Harry</PER>’s love of playing the hero .
He did not want to have to be alone with that great,  silent space, he could not stand it —   A picture behind him gave a particularly loud  grunting snore, and a cool voice said, “Ah ... <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter ...”   Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his  arms as he watched <PER>Harry</PER> with shrewd, narrow eyes.
“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed  wizard who hung on the wall behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  desk, “that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will soon be back with us?”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not stand this, he could not  stand being <PER>Harry</PER> anymore...
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, finally turning away  from the baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that  none of your fellow students are going to suffer  lasting damage from the night’s events.”   <PER>Harry</PER> tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out.
It  seemed to him that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was reminding him  of the amount of damage he had caused by his  actions tonight, and although <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was for  once looking at him directly, and though his  expression was kindly rather than accusatory, <PER>Harry</PER>  could not bear to meet his eyes.
He was sure that all the portraits around the  room were listening eagerly to every word <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  spoke, wondering where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had  been and why there had been injuries.
“I know how you are feeling, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  very quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned his back on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and stared  determinedly out of the opposite window.
He had probably  come to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> was as good as James had  been... <PER>Harry</PER> had never asked him...   “There is no shame in what you are feeling, <PER>Harry</PER>,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice.
“On the contrary ... the fact  that you can feel pain like this is your greatest  strength.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing  in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to  hurt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for his calmness and his empty  words.
“You care so much you feel as though you will bleed  to death with the pain of it.”   “I — DONT!” <PER>Harry</PER> screamed, so loudly that he felt  his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to  rush at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and break him too; shatter that  calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel  some tiny part of the horror inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Let me out,” <PER>Harry</PER> said yet again, in a voice that was  cold and almost as calm as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s.
If I had  been open with you, <PER>Harry</PER>, as I should have been,  you would have known a long time ago that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> might try and lure you to the Department  of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked  into going there tonight.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, then walked slowly across the room  now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood  and took the seat facing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s desk.
“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly  from <PER>Harry</PER>’s left, “that my great-great-grandson —  the last of the Blacks — is dead?”   “Yes, Phineas,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait,  calling for Sirius through the house...   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I owe you an explanation,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I guessed that it might be the sign of a  connection forged between you and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”         “You’ve told me this before, Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  bluntly.
For it  became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the  magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar  was giving you warnings when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was close to  you, or else feeling powerful emotion.”   “I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily.
“And this ability of yours — to detect <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  presence, even when he is disguised, and to know  what he is feeling when his emotions are roused —  has become more and more pronounced since  <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to his own body and his full  powers.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not bother to nod.
“More recently,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “I became  concerned that <PER>Voldemort</PER> might realize that this  connection between you exists.
I am  speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed  the attack on Mr. Weasley.”   “Yeah, <PER>Snape</PER> told me,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected him  quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, I  believe I was right to think that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have  made use of you in such a way.
An old  man’s mistake ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the feeling that a dormant snake  had risen in him, ready to strike, on those occasions  when he and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made eye contact.
In an attempt to arm you against  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s assaults on your mind, I arranged  Occlumency lessons with Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.”   He paused.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched the sunlight, which was  sliding slowly across the polished surface of  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a  handsome scarlet quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that the  portraits all around them were awake and listening  raptly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s explanation.
Phineas Nigellus had still not returned...   “Professor <PER>Snape</PER> discovered,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> resumed,  “that you had been dreaming about the door to the  Department of Mysteries for months.
“I didn’t practice, I  didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those  dreams, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept telling me to do it, if I had  he’d never have been able to show me where to go,  and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t — ”   Something was erupting inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head: a need  to justify himself, to explain —   “I tried to check if he’d really taken Sirius, I went to  Umbridge’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and  he said Sirius wasn’t there, he said he’d gone!”   “Kreacher lied,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
He went to the only Black family member  for whom he had any respect left... Black’s cousin  Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   “How do you know all this?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“When, however, you did not return from your trip  into the forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor  <PER>Snape</PER> grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be  a captive of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
But he gave  Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable  to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, yet must have seemed much too trivial  for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it.”   “Like what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> knew  already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that  you knew where he was — but Kreacher’s information  made him realize that the one person whom you  would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s lips were cold and numb.
when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last  night ...”   “The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s — undoubtedly on <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  instructions — had told him he must find a way of  keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the  vision of Sirius being tortured.
“But I  am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to  know when I am being lied to and I — persuaded him   — to tell me the full story, before I left for the  Department of Mysteries.”   “And,” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>, his hands curled in cold fists  on his knees, “and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept telling us to be nice  to him — ”   “She was quite right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kreacher ’s a lying   — foul — he deserved — ”   “Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had plainly not understood Sirius  at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered     “What about <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat.
When I told him <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  Sirius he just sneered at me as usual — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you know that Professor <PER>Snape</PER> had no choice  but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of  Dolores Umbridge,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> steadily, “but as  I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as  possible about what you had said.
It was he too who gave Professor  Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting  to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts...”   <PER>Harry</PER> disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in  blaming <PER>Snape</PER>, it seemed to be easing his own sense  of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  agree with him.
“<PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Snape</PER> g-goaded Sirius about staying in the  house — he made out Sirius was a coward — ”   “Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed  such feeble taunts to hurt him,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!”   <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
“I have  already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach  you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that  nothing could have been more dangerous than to  open your mind even further to <PER>Voldemort</PER> while in  my presence — ”   “<PER>Snape</PER> made it worse, my scar always hurt worse  after lessons with him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER>’s  thoughts on the subject and plunged on.
“How do you  know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for <PER>Voldemort</PER>,  make it easier for him to get inside my — ”   “I trust Severus <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
I thought  Professor <PER>Snape</PER> could overcome his feelings about  your father — I was wrong.”   “But that’s okay, is it?” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring the  scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the  portraits covering the walls.
“It’s okay for <PER>Snape</PER> to  hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate  Kreacher?”   “Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He had       no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living  reminder of the home Sirius had hated.”   “Yeah, he did hate it!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice cracking,  turning his back on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and walking away.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched him, but this  uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or  whatever it was from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, did not soften him.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lowered his hands and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER>  through his half-moon glasses.
I will  not stop you.”         <PER>Harry</PER> glared at him for a moment, then flung himself  back into the chair opposite <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and waited.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared for a moment at the sunlit  grounds outside the window, then looked back at  <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “Five years ago you arrived at  Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>, safe and whole, as I had planned  and intended.
And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital  wing, weak from your struggle with <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   “I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the  hospital wing, why <PER>Voldemort</PER> had tried to kill you  when you were a baby?”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
My only  defense is this: I have watched you struggling under  more burdens than any student who has ever passed  through this school, and I could not bring myself to  add another — the greatest one of all.”   <PER>Harry</PER> waited, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not speak.
I turned to leave.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to his feet and walked past <PER>Harry</PER> to  the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes’s perch.
He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside  it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around  the edges, in which <PER>Harry</PER> had seen his father      tormenting <PER>Snape</PER>.
Neither  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> nor any of the portraits made  a sound.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly, for  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed  completely lost in thought.
“It ... did that mean ...  What did that mean?”         “It meant,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “that the person who  has the only chance of conquering Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> for  good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years  ago.
This boy would be born to parents who had  already defied <PER>Voldemort</PER> three times.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though something was closing in upon  him.
but then, why was it my name on the  prophecy and not <PER>Neville</PER>’s?”   “The official record was relabeled after <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s  attack on you as a child,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“It  seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy  that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could only have tried to kill you  because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll  was referring.”   “Then — it might not be me?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I am afraid,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, looking as  though every word cost him a great effort, “that there  is no doubt that it is you.”         “But you said — <PER>Neville</PER> was born at the end of July  too — and his mum and dad — ”   “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the  final identifying feature of the boy who could  vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER>... <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself would ‘mark  him as his equal.’ And so he did, <PER>Harry</PER>.
He saw  himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in  marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he  intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which  have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times  so far — something that neither your parents, nor  <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents, ever achieved.”   “Why did he do it, then?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt numb  and cold.
He  should have waited to see whether <PER>Neville</PER> or I looked  more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill  whoever it was then — ”   “That might, indeed, have been the more practical  course,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “except that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  information about the prophecy was incomplete.
If he had not gone to save  Sirius, Sirius would not have died... More to stave off  the moment when he would have to think of Sirius  again, <PER>Harry</PER> asked, without caring much about the  answer, “The end of the prophecy ... it was something  about ... ‘neither can live...’ ”   “ ‘... while the other survives,’ ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I feel I owe you another explanation, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitantly.
I must  confess ... that I rather thought ... you had enough  responsibility to be going on with.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face into his long silver beard.
”        The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and  alarm from the Wizarding community, which as  recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry  assurances that there was “no truth whatsoever in  these persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is  operating amongst us once more.”   Details of the events that led to the Ministry  turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that  <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> and a select band of  followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to the  Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.
Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived —   “There you are, <PER>Harry</PER>, I knew they’d drag you into it  somehow,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking over the top of the  paper at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting on  the end of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed and they were both listening to  <PER>Hermione</PER> read the front page of the Sunday Prophet.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by  Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bed; <PER>Neville</PER>, whose nose had likewise  been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a  chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had  dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The  Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside down and  apparently not taking in a word <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
“Not such a show-off maniac  anymore, eh?”   He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs  from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a  few to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>, and ripped off the  wrapper of his own with his teeth.
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now scanning down the  article.
“ ‘You-Know- Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages  two to four, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us,  page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter, page nine ...’ Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, folding up      the newspaper and throwing it aside, “it’s certainly  given them lots to write about.
“He got a very good price for it  too, so we’re going to go on an expedition to Sweden  this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple-  Horned Snorkack.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to struggle with herself for a  moment, then said, “That sounds lovely.”   <PER>Ginny</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and looked away quickly,  grinning.
“So anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sitting up a little  straighter and wincing again, “what’s going on in  school?”   “Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,”  said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Must be  doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather disapproving and asked, “So  has all the trouble stopped now <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s back?”       “Yes,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, “everything’s settled right back  down again.”   “I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, propping a  Chocolate Frog card featuring <PER>Dumbledore</PER> against his  water jug.
“Sulking, more like,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>   “Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping  noises.
“No ... no ...” said Umbridge, sinking back into her  pillows, “no, I must have been dreaming...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> muffled their laughter in the  bedclothes.
Is  Firenze staying?”   “He’s got to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the other centaurs won’t  take him back, will they?”   “It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to  teach,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wishes he could’ve got rid of  Trelawney for good,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now munching on his  fourteenth Frog.
He had not told <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, or anyone else what the prophecy had  contained.
<PER>Neville</PER> had told them it had smashed while  <PER>Harry</PER> was pulling him up the steps in the Death  Room, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not yet corrected this  impression.
“Er — <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Wish we could come ...”   “Say hello to him for us!” called <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER>  proceeded down the ward.
He  thought he might really go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though;  he had not talked to him properly since he had  returned...   <PER>Harry</PER> had just descended the last marble step into  the entrance hall when <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle  emerged from a door on the right that <PER>Harry</PER> knew led       down to the Slytherin common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped  dead; so did <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the others.
Then he looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>  and said in a low voice, “You’re dead, Potter.”   <PER>Harry</PER> raised his eyebrows.
“Funny,” he said, “you’d  think I’d have stopped walking around...”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked angrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him.
“I  s’pose Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s just a warm-up act compared  to you three — what’s the matter?” he said, for  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked stricken at  the sound of the name.
“Still, at least  everyone knows what scumbags they are now — ”   <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand flew toward his wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> was  too quick for him.
“Potter!”   The voice rang across the entrance hall; <PER>Snape</PER> had  emerged from the staircase leading down to his office,  and at the sight of him <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great rush of  hatred beyond anything he felt toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> .
Whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, he would never forgive  <PER>Snape</PER> ... never ...   “What are you doing, Potter?” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly as  ever, as he strode over to the four of them.
“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sir,”  said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” said <PER>Snape</PER>, striding forward.
“Out of St. Mungo’s, I see!”   “Yes, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  shrugging off her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as  new.
What say you, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>?”   “What?” snapped <PER>Snape</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> knew he had  heard perfectly well.
“Well, Potter, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I think you ought to be outside  on a glorious day like this,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  continued briskly.
He thrust his wand  back inside his robes and headed straight for the  front doors without another glance at <PER>Snape</PER> and  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” he said, beaming, when <PER>Harry</PER>  approached the fence.
“You — er — feelin’ all righ’, are yeh?”       <PER>Harry</PER> knew from the look of concern on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s face  that he was not referring to <PER>Harry</PER>’s physical well-  being.
“I’m fine,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, because he could not  bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mind.
“Up in  a cave, like Sirius did when he — ”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at  <PER>Harry</PER>, and took a long draft of juice.
He’s a  good lad, really... I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find  him a lady friend, actually...”   <PER>Harry</PER> would normally have tried to persuade <PER>Hagrid</PER>  out of this idea at once.
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> softly and unexpectedly.
“I’ve got to go and visit <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the  hospital wing,” he said mechanically.
“Oh ... all  righ then, <PER>Harry</PER> ... Take care of yerself then, an’ drop  back in if yeh’ve got a mo...”   “Yeah ... right ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to the door as fast as he could and  pulled it open.
He closed his eyes for  a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that  he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the  grounds...         A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he  had seen the vision <PER>Voldemort</PER> had planted in his  mind, he would have given almost anything for the  Wizarding world to know that he had been telling the  truth, for them to believe that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back  and know that he was neither a liar nor mad.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the hospital wing completely  cured three days before the end of term.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but <PER>Ron</PER>  tended to make hushing noises every time she  mentioned his name.
“Come on, I’m starving...”   “I won’t be long... Look, you go ahead...”       But when the dormitory door closed behind <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Harry</PER> made no effort to speed up his packing.
He was  sure to mention <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s return; he had talked to  them about it last year, after all...   <PER>Harry</PER> pulled some crumpled robes out of the very  bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and,  as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying  in a corner of it.
<PER>Ginny</PER> told me.”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded curtly, but found that for some reason  he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius.
Firstly, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe,  and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for  the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses,  attempted to ambush <PER>Harry</PER> halfway down the train  as he made his way back from the toilet.
By the time Ernie  Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin      Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot  had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and  jinxes <PER>Harry</PER> had taught them, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and  Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic  slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as <PER>Harry</PER>,   Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack  and left them there to ooze.
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  mother’s face when he gets off the train,” said Ernie  with some satisfaction, as he watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> squirm  above him.
Anyway,  <PER>Harry</PER>, the food trolley’s just stopped if you want  anything...”   <PER>Harry</PER> thanked the others and accompanied <PER>Ron</PER> back  to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of  Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was  reading the Daily Prophet again, <PER>Ginny</PER> was doing a  quiz in The Quibbler, and <PER>Neville</PER> was stroking his  Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal  over the year and now made odd crooning noises  when touched.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> whiled away most of the journey  playing wizard chess while <PER>Hermione</PER> read out  snippets from the Prophet It was now full of articles  about how to repel dementors, attempts by the  Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical  letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER> walking past their house that very  morning.
“But it  won’t be long now...”   “Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, nodding toward the glass  window onto the corridor.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back down at the  chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns  chased off its square by <PER>Ron</PER>’s knight.
“Who’s she with now anyway?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>,  but it was <PER>Ginny</PER> who answered.
When the ticket inspector signaled to him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> that it was safe to walk through the  magical barrier between platforms nine and ten,  however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the  other side: a group of people standing there to greet  him whom he had not expected at all.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward  and hugging her children tightly.
“Oh, and <PER>Harry</PER> dear  — how are you?”   “Fine,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>, as she pulled him into a tight  embrace.
“Business is booming and we  thought we’d treat ourselves.”   “Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of  <PER>Harry</PER> and turned to greet <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned an inch or  so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and  there, sure enough, were the three <PER>Dursley</PER>s, who  looked positively appalled to see <PER>Harry</PER>’s reception  committee.
“Ah, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Mr. Weasley, turning from  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s parents, whom he had been greeting  enthusiastically, and who were taking it in turns to  hug <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You might remember me, my name’s Arthur  Weasley.”   As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most  of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ living room two years previously,   <PER>Harry</PER> would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon  had forgotten him.
“Yes,” said Mr. Weasley, “even if you won’t let <PER>Harry</PER>  use the fellytone — ”   “ Telephone ,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes, I’d have to say  you do, <PER>Dursley</PER>.”   He turned from Uncle Vernon to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> anxiously,  shaking <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Really soon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“Lord Vol — ”   “ <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>\” snarled Fudge.
<PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> is back.”   “Back?
“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?”   “<PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> has now been joined by  those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in  January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more  rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a  lime-green blur.
And why, <PER>Snape</PER>, is  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter still alive, when you have had him at  your mercy for five years?”   She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the  color high in her cheeks.
“While I endured the dementors, you  remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s pet!”   “Not quite,” said <PER>Snape</PER> calmly.
Still spying on  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a master you believed dead?”   “Hardly,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, “although the Dark Lord is  pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen  years of information on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to give him when  he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back  present than endless reminiscences of how  unpleasant Azkaban is.
I returned on  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders.”   “On <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s — ?” she began, in tones of  outrage.
By allowing  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to think that I was only returning to the  Dark Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have  been able to pass information on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and the  Order of the Phoenix ever since!
“No, you  were once again absent while the rest of us ran  dangers, were you not, <PER>Snape</PER>?”   “My orders were to remain behind,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
I am asking you, <PER>Snape</PER>!”         “If I had murdered <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, the Dark Lord could  not have used his blood to regenerate, making him  invincible — ”   “You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she  jeered.
I         would have been a fool to risk it with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  close at hand.”   “And through all this we are supposed to believe  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has never suspected you?” asked  Bellatrix.
But through all these years, he has never stopped  trusting Severus <PER>Snape</PER>, and therein lies my great  value to the Dark Lord.”   Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared  unsure how best to attack <PER>Snape</PER> next.
“Even  <PER>Snape</PER> says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your  silence!”   But <PER>Snape</PER> had gotten to his feet and strode to the  small window, peered through the curtains at the  deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk.
And I  will say this for <PER>Malfoy</PER>: He isn’t shrinking away from  his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself,  excited at the prospect — ”   Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly  all the while at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“To punish Lucius?”   “If <PER>Malfoy</PER> succeeds,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, still looking away  from her, “he will be honored above all others.”   “But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa.
You see, in the unlikely event that <PER>Malfoy</PER>  succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little  longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.”   “In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if <PER>Malfoy</PER> is  killed!”   “The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated <PER>Snape</PER>  quietly.
“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, as he  attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?”   “I will,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And, should it prove necessary ... if it seems <PER>Malfoy</PER>  will fail ...” whispered Narcissa (<PER>Snape</PER>’s hand  twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will  you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has  ordered <PER>Malfoy</PER> to perform?”   There was a moment’s silence.
Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent  disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which  <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> was sighted once more.
Said Mrs. Augusta  Longbottom, “My grandson, <PER>Neville</PER> — a good friend of  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death  Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and —      But the rest of this story was obscured by the large  birdcage standing on top of it.
Hoping  to see you this Friday,   I am, yours most sincerely,   Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>   Though he already knew it by heart, <PER>Harry</PER> had been  stealing glances at this missive every few minutes  since seven o’clock that evening, when he had first  taken up his position beside his bedroom window,  which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet  Drive.
He knew it was pointless to keep rereading  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s words; <PER>Harry</PER> had sent back his “yes”  with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could  do now was wait: Either <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to  come, or he was not.
He  could not shrug off the feeling that something was  going to go wrong — his reply to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s letter  might have gone astray; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could be  prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn  out not to be from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at all, but a trick or  joke or trap.
He had completely  forgotten to warn the <PER>Dursley</PER>s that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  might be coming.
I  daresay <PER>Harry</PER> has told you I would be coming for  him?”   <PER>Harry</PER> ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an  abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long  experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s  reach of his uncle whenever possible.
Vernon  <PER>Dursley</PER>, whose mustache was quite as bushy as      <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s, though black, and who was wearing a  puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as  though he could not believe his tiny eyes.
“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, <PER>Harry</PER> did  not warn you that I was coming,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  pleasantly.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not  doubt that speech would return to him, and soon —  the vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple was reaching  danger point — but something about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath.
“Ah, good evening <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking  up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most  satisfied expression.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, when Uncle  Vernon failed to effect an introduction.
“And this must be your son,  <PER>Dudley</PER>?”   <PER>Dudley</PER> had that moment peered round the living  room door.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> waited a moment or two, apparently to  see whether any of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were going to say  anything, but as the silence stretched on he smiled.
<PER>Dudley</PER> scrambled out of the way as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  passed him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still clutching the telescope and  trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had settled himself in the armchair  nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings  with an expression of benign interest.
We shall trespass  upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little  longer.”   “You will, will you?”   Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> had entered the room, Petunia at his  shoulder, and <PER>Dudley</PER> skulking behind them both.
“Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply, “I shall.”   He drew his wand so rapidly that <PER>Harry</PER> barely saw it;  with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and  knocked the knees out from under all three of the  <PER>Dursley</PER> s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap.
“Sir — what happened to your — ?”   “Later, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Please sit down.”   <PER>Harry</PER> took the remaining armchair, choosing not to  look at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, who seemed stunned into  silence.
“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raising his glass to <PER>Harry</PER>, who caught  hold of his own and sipped.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not suppress a suspicion that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was rather enjoying himself.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning toward him,  “a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able  to solve for us.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> both turned to look  at him.
He did not ask <PER>Harry</PER> why he  had not confided in the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
Naturally we had to move out until such  time as we have clarified the position.”   “But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to  own it?”   “Fortunately,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “there is a simple  test.”   He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his  chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle       Vernon shouted, “ Will you get these ruddy things off  us?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around; all three of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s were  cowering with their arms over their heads as their  glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their  contents flying everywhere.
“But it would have been better manners to drink it,  you know.”   It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with  any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely  shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and  <PER>Dudley</PER> and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes  on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand.
“You see,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, turning back to <PER>Harry</PER>  and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not  uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you  have also inherited — ”   He flicked his wand for a fifth time.
<PER>Dudley</PER> drew his large, bare, pink feet  off the floor and sat with them raised almost above  his head, as though he thought the creature might  run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon  bellowed, “What the hell is that?”   “Kreacher,” finished <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes,  Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his  new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat,  Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ”   “As you can see, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly, over  Kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,”  “Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into  your ownership.”   “I don’t care,” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, looking with disgust  at the writhing, stamping house-elf.
Bearing in mind that he has lived  at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for  the past year?”   “Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> has been looking  after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours  now, so if you would prefer to make different  arrangements — ”         “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, “he can stay with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
I  think Buckbeak would prefer that.”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER> will be delighted,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling.
Now, <PER>Harry</PER>, is your trunk packed?”   “Erm ...”   “Doubtful that I would turn up?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  suggested shrewdly.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was humming  quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the  atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and <PER>Harry</PER>  did not dare look at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s as he said,   “Professor — I’m ready now.”         “Good,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“As you will no doubt be aware, <PER>Harry</PER> comes of age in  a year’s time — ”   “No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time  since <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arrival.
He’s a month younger than <PER>Dudley</PER>,  and Dudders doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after  next.”   “Ah,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pleasantly, “but in the  Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.”   Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whom Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has already  attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even  greater danger now than the day when I left him upon  your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter  explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing  the hope that you would care for him as though he  were your own.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused, and although his voice remained  light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger,  <PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of chill emanating from him and  noticed that the <PER>Dursley</PER>s drew very slightly closer  together.
I ask only this: that you allow  <PER>Harry</PER> to return, once more, to this house, before his  seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the  protection continues until that time.”   None of the <PER>Dursley</PER>s said anything.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER> ... time for us to be off,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  at last, standing up and straightening his long black  cloak.
“Bye,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s, and followed  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who paused beside <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk, upon  which Hedwig’s cage was perched.
However, I  would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just  in case.”   <PER>Harry</PER> extracted his cloak from his trunk with some  difficulty, trying not to show <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the mess  within.
“And now, <PER>Harry</PER>, let us step out into the night and  pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”           HORACE SLUGHORN   Despite the fact that he had spent every waking  moment of the past few days hoping desperately that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would indeed come to fetch him, <PER>Harry</PER>  felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet  Drive together.
The memory of their last face-to-face encounter  kept intruding too, and it rather heightened <PER>Harry</PER>’s  sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that  occasion, not to mention done his best to smash  several of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s most prized possessions.
My left, if you don’t mind —  as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at  the moment.”   <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s proffered forearm.
“Well, here we go.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arm twist away from him and  redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything  went black; he was being pressed very hard from all  directions; he could not breathe, there were iron  bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were  being forced back into his head; his eardrums were  being pushed deeper into his skull and then —   He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened  his streaming eyes.
“So tell me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I  thought it would be burning all the time now  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s getting so powerful again.”   He glanced up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and saw that he was  wearing a satisfied expression.
It appears that he is now  employing Occlumency against you.”       “Well, I’m not complaining,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who missed  neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling  flashes of insight into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  again.
“Professor?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Er — where exactly are we?”   “This, <PER>Harry</PER>, is the charming village of Budleigh  Babberton.”   “And what are we doing here?”   “Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not consider it  rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that  conversation had been established, he had more  pressing questions to ask.
Rufus is a man of action  and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his  working life, does not underestimate Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”         <PER>Harry</PER> waited, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not say anything  about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the  Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the  nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it.
You have not asked me, for  instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check  that I am indeed Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and not an  impostor.”   “I didn’t ...” <PER>Harry</PER> began, not entirely sure whether he  was being reprimanded or not.
“For future reference, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is raspberry ...  although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would       have been sure to research my own jam preferences  before impersonating myself.”   “Er ... right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too busy digesting the horrible  idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything  else, but as they reached the front gate, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  stopped dead and <PER>Harry</PER> walked into him.
Holding his illuminated wand aloft, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  walked into the sitting room with <PER>Harry</PER> right behind  him.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s small intake of breath made  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> look around.
Yes.”     And without warning, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> swooped, plunging  the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed  armchair, which yelled, “Ouch!”   “Good evening, Horace,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  straightening up again.
“Ohol”   “This,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, moving forward to make the  introduction, “is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
<PER>Harry</PER>, this is an old  friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.”   Slughorn turned on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his expression  shrewd.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> and directed him toward  a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so  recently impersonated, which stood right beside the  newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the seat with the distinct impression that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for some reason, wanted to keep him as  visible as possible.
“Here — ” He gave a  drink to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had sat down without  invitation, thrust the tray at <PER>Harry</PER>, and then sank  into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a  disgruntled silence.
“Reactions not what they were, I see.”   “You’re quite right,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> serenely,  shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those  burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made  the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
But on the other  hand ...”   He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to  say that age had its compensations, and <PER>Harry</PER>  noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had  never seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wear before: It was large,  rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and  was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked  down the middle.
Never liked her.”   <PER>Harry</PER> chuckled and both <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Slughorn  looked round at him.
“Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of  them has ever been killed — well, unless you count  Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he  was working with <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure Slughorn would be one of those  wizards who could not bear to hear <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name  spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn  gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which <PER>Harry</PER>  ignored.
“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the  only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> ever feared, isn’t he?” <PER>Harry</PER> went  on.
“Well, yes, it is true that <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>  has never sought a fight with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” he  muttered grudgingly.
Well,  <PER>Harry</PER>, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality  quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.”   Not at all reluctant to obey, <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to his feet.
He twiddled his fat  thumbs and fidgeted as he watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  fasten his traveling cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER> zip up his jacket.
As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice  floated after them, “111 want a pay rise, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> chuckled.
“Well done, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Horace,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, relieving <PER>Harry</PER> of the  responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort.
...   “If you don’t mind, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as they  passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with  you before we part.
A little puzzled, <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through  the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the  average cupboard.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> illuminated the tip of  his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled  down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
A brutal  ending to what should have been a long and happy  relationship.”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider  now climbing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hat.
He could tell that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> understood, that he might even suspect  that until his letter arrived, <PER>Harry</PER> had spent nearly all  his time at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ lying on his bed, refusing  meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the  chill emptiness that he had come to associate with  dementors.
...”         “But while I was at the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ ...” interrupted  <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t  shut myself away or — or crack up.
But if it is,”  he said fiercely, now looking straight into  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight,   “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me  as I can, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> too if I can manage it.”   “Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and  Sirius’s true godson!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, with an  approving pat on <PER>Harry</PER>’s back.
“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your  friends, Mr. <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley and Miss <PER>Hermione</PER>  Granger.
You do them a  disservice by not confiding something this important  to them.”   “I didn’t want — ”   “ — to worry or frighten them?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  surveying <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of his half-moon  spectacles.
As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have  wanted you to shut yourself away.”   <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not seem to  require an answer.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited hopefully, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not  elaborate, so he asked something else that had been  bothering him slightly.
“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do  Occlumency lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>, will I?”   “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> — and no, you will not.”   “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in relief, “because they were a — ”   He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor  <PER>Snape</PER> from now on,” he said, “because he won’t let  me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my  O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.”   “Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely.
Let us not deprive Molly  any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.”            AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> approached the back door of  the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar  litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons;  <PER>Harry</PER> could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens  coming from a distant shed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knocked  three times and <PER>Harry</PER> saw sudden movement behind  the kitchen window.
“Declare yourself!”   “It is I, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, bringing <PER>Harry</PER>.”   The door opened at once.
Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright,  you said not to expect you before morning!”   “We were lucky,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ushering <PER>Harry</PER>  over the threshold.
“Wotcher, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Hi, Tonks.”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there  was something forced in her smile.
“Thanks for  the tea and sympathy, Molly.”   “Please don’t leave on my account,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to  discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.”   “No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes.
“ ’Night — ”   “Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend,   Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?”   “No, really, Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night,  everyone.”   Tonks hurried past <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> into the  yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on  the spot and vanished into thin air.
“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Are  you hungry, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, suddenly realizing just how  hungry he was.
Hedwig hooted happily at <PER>Harry</PER> from her perch on top  of a large wardrobe, then took off through the  window; <PER>Harry</PER> knew she had been waiting to see him  before going hunting.
Did they treat you okay?”   “Same as usual,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> perched  herself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me  much, but I like it better that way.
How’re you,  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Oh, I’m fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was scrutinizing  <PER>Harry</PER> as though he was sickening for something.
“We thought — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> flashed a warning look at <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER>  changed tack at top speed.
“Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “What’s up with you?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
“It’s her,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, plonking herself down on  <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“She’s so  full of herself.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was astonished to hear <PER>Hermione</PER> talking about  Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame <PER>Ron</PER> for       saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off her for five  seconds?”   “Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>.
The bedroom door flew open again, and <PER>Harry</PER>  instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so  hard that <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> slid off the bed onto  the floor.
He could not help noticing  how Mrs. Weasley, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were all  determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
I expect  that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.”   “Stop calling her that, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said Mrs. Weasley  sharply, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed.
“Well, you do,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but if she jumps out at you  unexpectedly, like then ...”   “It’s pathetic,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> furiously, striding away  from <PER>Ron</PER> as far as she could go and turning to face  him with her arms folded once she had reached the  wall.
“You don’t really want her around forever?” <PER>Ginny</PER>  asked <PER>Ron</PER> incredulously.
I mean, Tonks is okay-looking  when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her  nose, but — ”   “She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>   “And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> from the corner.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was  just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — ”   “I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” she whispered, “come downstairs  and help me with the lunch.”   “I’m talking to this lot!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, outraged.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was peering into Fred and  George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast  sideways looks at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who was now helping  himself to <PER>Harry</PER>’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at  the door.
“Dunno,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but if Fred and George’ve left it  here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so  be careful.”   “Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now  about <PER>Voldemort</PER> being back — ”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> says people find it far easier to forgive  others for being wrong than being right,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I heard him telling your mum, <PER>Ron</PER>.”   “Sounds like the sort of mental thing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  would say,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> choked on his bit of toast, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped.
“He  told me last night in your broom shed.”   “Blimey ... private lessons with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, looking impressed.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him and <PER>Hermione</PER>  exchange looks.
He fixed his eyes on his fork,  which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his  lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to  be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because  of the prophecy.”   Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke.
“It got smashed.”   “Although the Prophet says — ” began <PER>Ron</PER>, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Shh!”   “The Prophet’s got it right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking up at  them both with a great effort: <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed  frightened and <PER>Ron</PER> amazed.
From what it said,” <PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath, “it  looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>; the breakfast  tray slid to the floor with a crash.
“Don’t worry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was plainly trying not to  laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor  injuries — ”   “Oh well, never mind that now!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  hastily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry ...  Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but  from what Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> said about the prophecy,  how it was about you and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, well, we  thought it might be something like this.
... Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>  ...” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you  scared?”   “Not as much as I was,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”   “When we heard <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was collecting you in  person, we thought he might be telling you something       or showing you something to do with the prophecy,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly.
He knew that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere  fact that they were still there on either side of him,  speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking  from him as though he were contaminated or  dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell  them.
...”         But when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived downstairs ten minutes later,  fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it  was to find <PER>Hermione</PER> sitting at the kitchen table in  great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her  resemblance to half a panda.
“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying  anxiously, standing over <PER>Hermione</PER> with her wand in  her hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at  “Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always  worked before, I just can’t understand it.”   “It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke,  making sure it can’t come off,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>   “But it’s got to come off!” squeaked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
I thought  Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking  back — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, will you shut up, you’re not the only one  who’s nervous!” barked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I know I’ve failed everything!”   “What happens if we fail?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked the room at  large, but it was again <PER>Hermione</PER> who answered.
“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I  asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> at the end of last term.”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach squirmed.
“They’re definitely owls,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, jumping  up to join <PER>Hermione</PER> at the window.
“Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...”       She gripped both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tightly around the  elbows.
To his left, <PER>Ron</PER> was trying to  detach his own results; to his right, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  hands were shaking so much she was making her  whole owl tremble.

<PER>Hermione</PER> had her back to him and  her head bent, but <PER>Ron</PER> was looking delighted.
“Here —  swap — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced down <PER>Ron</PER>’s grades: There were no  “Outstandings” there.
...   “Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,”  said <PER>Ron</PER>, punching <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder.
“Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and  George got together!”         “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ginny</PER> tentatively, for <PER>Hermione</PER> still  hadn’t turned around.
“You’re actually  disappointed, aren’t you?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> shook her head, but <PER>Harry</PER> laughed.
He spent most of his  days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’  orchard (he and <PER>Hermione</PER> against <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>;  <PER>Hermione</PER> was dreadful and <PER>Ginny</PER> good, so they were  reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating  triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front  of him.
“And that goes for returning to  Hogwarts as well!”   <PER>Ron</PER> turned to stare incredulously at <PER>Harry</PER> as his  mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering  clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.
...”   But <PER>Ron</PER> was careful not to be flippant about  <PER>Voldemort</PER> over the next few days.
Bill, who  would be staying at home with Fleur (much to  <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s pleasure), passed a full money  bag across the table to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> choked over his  cornflakes, and <PER>Ron</PER> thumped him on the back.
He, <PER>Harry</PER>,   <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were all sitting in roomy  comfort in the wide backseat.
There were no Aurors waiting  outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-  bearded form of Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Hogwarts  gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming  at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and oblivious to the  startled stares of passing Muggles.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” he boomed, sweeping <PER>Harry</PER> into a bone-  crushing hug the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped out of  the car.
“Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh  should see him, <PER>Harry</PER>, he’s so happy ter be back in  the open air — ”   “Glad he’s pleased,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning as he  massaged his ribs.
See, the Ministry  wanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  said I’d do,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly, throwing out his  chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets.
He  looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he  could speak, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said importantly, “Jus’ passin’  through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts  business, yeh know.”   Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses;  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and the Weasleys walked  through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard  at the back where the dustbins stood.
“I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first,  <PER>Hermione</PER> wants new dress robes, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s showing       much too much ankle in his school robes, and you  must need new ones too, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve grown so  much — come on, everyone — ”   “Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to  Madam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, do  you think — ?”   “Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin  lid.
Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but  allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish  and Blotts with her husband and <PER>Ginny</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> set off for Madam  Malkin’s.
“I’ll stand  guard outside, all right?”   So <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the little shop  together.
He  strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a  few moments before he noticed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> reflected over his shoulder.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a  Mudblood just walked in,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!”  she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had  shown her <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both standing there with  their wands out and pointing at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Put those away,” she said coldly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I see that being <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite has given you  a false sense of security, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
But  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t always be there to protect you.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked mockingly all around the shop.
They might be able to find you a double cell in  Azkaban with your loser of a husband!”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> made an angry movement toward <PER>Harry</PER>, but  stumbled over his overlong robe.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” moaned <PER>Hermione</PER>, grabbing his arm and  attempting to push it down by his side.
She bent  toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was still glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’re right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said Narcissa, with a  contemptuous glance at <PER>Hermione</PER>, “now I know the  kind of scum that shops here.
... We’ll do better at  Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”   And with that, the pair of them strode out of the  shop, <PER>Malfoy</PER> taking care to bang as hard as he could  into <PER>Ron</PER> on the way out.
She was distracted all through the fitting of <PER>Ron</PER>’s and  <PER>Harry</PER>’s new robes, tried to sell <PER>Hermione</PER> wizard’s  dress robes instead of witch’s, and when she finally  bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of  being glad to see the back of them.
“Did you see the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, unconcerned.
Don’ worry abou’ them.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks, but  before they could disabuse <PER>Hagrid</PER> of this comfortable  notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and <PER>Ginny</PER> appeared, all  clutching heavy packages of books.
...”   Neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> bought any ingredients at the  Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying  Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for  Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium.
“No they won’t!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was  laughing.
Not for sale to under-sixteens.’  You know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>, “that  really is extraordinary magic!”   “For that, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said a voice behind them, “you  can have one for free.”         A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of  magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his  flaming hair.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>,  I’ll give you a tour.”   <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Hermione</PER> dabbing her black eye with paste  and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where  he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.
“Take whatever you like, and just  remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.”   George swept off through the curtain to help with the  customers, and Fred led <PER>Harry</PER> back into the main  part of the shop to find <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> still  poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both  hung back, looking wary.
“But we’re not  selling them to our sister,” he added, becoming  suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five  boys on the go from what we’ve — ”   “Whatever you’ve heard from <PER>Ron</PER> is a big fat lie,” said  <PER>Ginny</PER> calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink  pot off the shelf.
And I’ll thank you,” she  added angrily to <PER>Ron</PER>, who had just appeared at  George’s elbow, laden with merchandise, “not to tell  tales about me to these two!”   “That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said  Fred, examining the many boxes in <PER>Ron</PER>’s arms.
...”   Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs,  and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> momentarily had an  unimpeded view out of the window.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was  hurrying up the street alone.
Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER> would not have let her precious son  out of her sight willingly; <PER>Malfoy</PER> must have made a       real effort to free himself from her clutches.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  knowing and loathing <PER>Malfoy</PER>, was sure the reason  could not be innocent.
“Oh — I don’t know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking  uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under  the cloak with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they  could, but by the time they gained the street, <PER>Malfoy</PER>  had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
“He was going in that direction,” murmured <PER>Harry</PER> as  quietly as possible, so that the humming <PER>Hagrid</PER>  would not hear them.
There in the midst of the cases full of skulls  and old bottles stood <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> with his back to  them, just visible beyond the very same large black  cabinet in which <PER>Harry</PER> had once hidden to avoid  <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his father.
“Extendable Ears, look!”   “Fantastic!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> unraveled the  long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them  toward the bottom of the door.
I couldn’t guarantee  anything.”       “No?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew, just by his tone,  that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was sneering.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> shuffled  sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they  could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
Just don’t  sell it.”   “Of course not ... sir.”   Borgin made a bow as deep as the one <PER>Harry</PER> had  once seen him give Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
He passed so close to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and       <PER>Hermione</PER> that they felt the cloak flutter around their  knees again.
<PER>Ron</PER> hastily fed the Extendable Ears  back under the door and passed one of the strings to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the nasty  feeling he knew exactly what <PER>Hermione</PER> was up to.
“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just  now, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I  want to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already  reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him  the same thing, so ... um ...”   It was a pretty lame story in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, and  apparently Borgin thought so too.
“Ah well,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing the cloak back over  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> bickered all the way back to  Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to  stop so that they could dodge undetected around a  very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who  had clearly noticed their absence.
7      THE SLUG CLUB   <PER>Harry</PER> spent a lot of the last week of the holidays  pondering the meaning of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s behavior in  Knockturn Alley.
To his slight annoyance, however, neither  <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed quite as curious about  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed  to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> a little impatiently.
“Remember that  shriveled-up arm <PER>Malfoy</PER> had?”   “But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep  that one safe’?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> for the umpteenth time.
“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of  the broken objects, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> wants both.”   “You reckon?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now trying to scrape some  dirt off his broom handle.
When neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor  <PER>Hermione</PER> answered, he said, “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s father’s in  Azkaban.
Don’t you think <PER>Malfoy</PER>’d like revenge?”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked up, blinking.
His father’s a Death Eater  and — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind  <PER>Hermione</PER>, his mouth open.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an anxious voice.
You think You-Know-  Who would let <PER>Malfoy</PER> join?”   “It seems very unlikely, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a  repressive sort of voice.
He’s  been branded with the Dark Mark.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
“I think he just wanted to get out of there, <PER>Harry</PER>,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It was the Mark, I know it — he was  showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw  how seriously Borgin took him!”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged another look.
I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold  — pink would of course be ’orrible with <PER>Ginny</PER>’s ’air —     “Ah, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across  Fleur’s monologue.
The Ministry cars glided up to  the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks  packed; <PER>Hermione</PER>’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed  in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; <PER>Ron</PER>’s owl,  Pigwidgeon; and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s new purple Pygmy Puff,  Arnold, in cages.
<PER>Ron</PER> hurried forward, looking hopeful, but  <PER>Ginny</PER> stuck out her foot and <PER>Ron</PER> fell, sprawling in  the dust at Fleur’s feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER> had better go first, with — ”   She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who  nodded briefly, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s upper arm, and  attempted to steer him toward the barrier between  platforms nine and ten.
Without waiting to consult his grim-faced  Auror, <PER>Harry</PER> motioned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to follow  him up the platform, looking for an empty  compartment.
“We can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking apologetic.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first  and then patrol the corridors for a bit.”   “Oh yeah, I forgot,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Am I about to discover where you, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> disappeared to while you were supposed to  be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?”   “How did you — ?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, please.
You’re talking to the man who raised  Fred and George.”   “Er ... yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.”   “Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.”   “Well, we followed <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
We used my  Invisibility Cloak.”   “Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or  was it a mere whim?”   “Because I thought <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to something,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, disregarding Mr. Weasley’s look of mingled  exasperation and amusement.
After a moment he  said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would  allow a sixteen-year-old — ”   “Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would  or wouldn’t do?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
If <PER>Malfoy</PER>  wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten  Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or  dangerous, isn’t it?”   “I doubt it, to be honest, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Mr. Weasley  slowly.
“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all  fixed with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, so we’ll see you quite soon,”  said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as <PER>Harry</PER>  slammed the door shut behind him and the train         began to move.
He supposed <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> were cloistered in the prefects’  carriage, but <PER>Ginny</PER> was a little way along the  corridor, chatting to some friends.
“Fancy trying to find a compartment?”   “I can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>, I said I’d meet Dean,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>  brightly.
He felt a strange twinge of  annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair  dancing behind her; he had become so used to her  presence over the summer that he had almost  forgotten that <PER>Ginny</PER> did not hang around with him,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> while at school.
“<PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> in relief, turning to see a round-  faced boy struggling toward him.
“Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said a girl with long hair and large  misty eyes, who was just behind <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s childhood had been blighted by <PER>Voldemort</PER>  just as much as <PER>Harry</PER>’s had, but <PER>Neville</PER> had no idea  how close he had come to having <PER>Harry</PER>’s destiny.
The  prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet,  for his own inscrutable reasons, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  chosen to believe that <PER>Harry</PER> was the one meant.
Had <PER>Voldemort</PER> chosen <PER>Neville</PER>, it would be <PER>Neville</PER>  sitting opposite <PER>Harry</PER> bearing the lightning-shaped  scar and the weight of the prophecy.
Would <PER>Neville</PER>’s mother have died to save him, as Lily  had died for <PER>Harry</PER>?
An empty seat where <PER>Neville</PER> now sat and  a scarless <PER>Harry</PER> who would have been kissed good-  bye by his own mother, not <PER>Ron</PER>’s?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> caught  each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of  Quidditch.
It was during one of the clear spells,  when the sun was visible almost directly overhead,  that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the compartment at  last.
“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> longingly, slumping into the seat beside  <PER>Harry</PER> and rubbing his stomach.
“I’m supposed to deliver these to <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom  and <PER>Harry</PER> P-Potter,” she faltered, as her eyes met  <PER>Harry</PER>’s and she turned scarlet.
Perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> took the scroll addressed  to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the  compartment.
“What is it?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded, as <PER>Harry</PER> unrolled his.
<PER>Harry</PER>,   I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of  lunch in compartment C.   Sincerely,   Professor H. E. F. Slug horn   “Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked <PER>Neville</PER>, looking  perplexedly at his own invitation.
He  recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy  with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there  were also two seventh-year boys <PER>Harry</PER> did not know  and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and  looking as though she was not entirely sure how she  had got there, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course —     Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or  greeting, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Neville</PER>: Gryffindor and  Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
No?”   McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand,  and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> nodded back at him.
<PER>Ginny</PER> grimaced at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> from behind  Slughorn’s back.
“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the  pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn  told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>, now passing around a basket  of rolls.
It was <PER>Neville</PER>’s turn next: This was a very  uncomfortable ten minutes, for <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents, well-  known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by  Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater  cronies.
At the end of <PER>Neville</PER>’s interview, <PER>Harry</PER> had  the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment  on <PER>Neville</PER>, yet to see whether he had any of his  parents’ flair.
I feel I barely  scratched the surface when we met over the summer!”  He contemplated <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment as though he  was a particularly large and succulent piece of  pheasant, then said, “ The Chosen One,’ they’re  calling you now!”         <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
“<PER>Neville</PER> and I  were both there too, and all this ‘Chosen One’ rubbish  is just the Prophet making things up as usual.”   “You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn  with great interest, looking from <PER>Ginny</PER> to <PER>Neville</PER>, but  both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging  smile.
“I remember dear Gwenog telling  me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the  Holyhead Harpies) — ”   He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence,  but <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that Slughorn  had not finished with him, and that he had not been  convinced by <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Well, off you go,  off you go!”   As he pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> into the darkening corridor,  Zabini shot him a filthy look that <PER>Harry</PER> returned with  interest.
He, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> followed Zabini back  along the train.
“How come you ended up in there, <PER>Ginny</PER>?”   “He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized the door and pushed it open, hard;  Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over  sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing  ruckus, <PER>Harry</PER> darted into the compartment, leapt  onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted  himself up into the luggage rack.
It was fortunate that  Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing  all eyes onto them, for <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure his feet  and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had  flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible  moment he thought he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes follow his      trainer as it whipped upward out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay  curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that  every inch of him remained hidden, and watched  Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone  would have loved to have been in her place.
What would <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  say about this?
“We’d better get our robes on.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was so busy staring at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, he did not notice  Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down,  it hit <PER>Harry</PER> hard on the side of the head.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not afraid of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but he still did not  much like the idea of being discovered hiding under  his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly  Slytherins.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see the corridors filling up again and  hoped that <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> would take his things  out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he  was until the compartment had quite emptied.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were alone in the  compartment.
“Petrificus Totalusl”   Without warning, <PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed his wand at <PER>Harry</PER>,  who was instantly paralyzed.
...”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> dragged the cloak out from under <PER>Harry</PER>’s  immobilized body and threw it over him.
“See you around, Potter ...  or not.”   And taking care to tread on <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers, <PER>Malfoy</PER>  left the compartment.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never hated <PER>Malfoy</PER> more than as he lay  there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood  dripping sickeningly into his open mouth.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would think that he had left the  train without them.
A  feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he  imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages  trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of  laughter issuing from whichever carriage <PER>Malfoy</PER> was  riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on  <PER>Harry</PER> to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.
...   Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a  voice overhead said, “Wotcher, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   There was a flash of red light and <PER>Harry</PER>’s body  unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more  dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his       bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his  head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the  Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away.
“Who did it?”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“Was that a Patronus?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who had seen  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> send messages like this.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  bewitched them himself.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
It was  not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away  from them, and <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled off his Invisibility  Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized,  with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose  and long, black, greasy hair of Severus <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Nice  of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently  decided that the wearing of school robes would  detract from your appearance.”   “I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began,  but <PER>Snape</PER> cut across him.
And incidentally,”       said <PER>Snape</PER>, standing back to allow <PER>Harry</PER> to pass him,  “I was interested to see your new Patronus.”   He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and  tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they  slithered, clinking, back into place.
“The  new one looks weak.”   As <PER>Snape</PER> swung the lantern about, <PER>Harry</PER> saw,  fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s face.
“Good night,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to her over his shoulder, as  he began the walk up to the school with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Thanks for ... everything.”   “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Snape</PER> did not speak for a minute or so.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as  though his body was generating waves of hatred so  powerful that it seemed incredible that <PER>Snape</PER> could  not feel them burning him.
He had loathed <PER>Snape</PER>  from their first encounter, but <PER>Snape</PER> had placed  himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility  of <PER>Harry</PER>’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius.
Whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> had had time to  think over the summer, and had concluded that  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining  safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the  Phoenix were off fighting <PER>Voldemort</PER> had probably  been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the  Ministry the night that he had died.
<PER>Harry</PER> clung to  this notion, because it enabled him to blame <PER>Snape</PER>,  which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if  anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the  man now striding next to him in the darkness.
You might  have set a record, Potter.”   The fury and hatred bubbling inside <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to  blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been  immobilized all the way back to London than tell  <PER>Snape</PER> why he was late.
He knew that <PER>Snape</PER> had come  to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he  could needle and torment <PER>Harry</PER> without anyone else  listening.
As though he had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, however, <PER>Snape</PER>  said, “No cloak.
You can walk in so that everyone sees  you, which is what you wanted, I’m sure.”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned on the spot and marched straight  through the open doors: anything to get away from       <PER>Snape</PER>.
It was all a  shimmering blur to <PER>Harry</PER>, however, who walked so  fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before  people really started to stare, and by the time they  were standing up to get a good look at him, he had  spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, sped along the benches  toward them, and forced his way in between them.
He was very  conscious that <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, and Seamus  were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the  Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench  to eavesdrop.
“Not now, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in a darkly  significant voice.
“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as  <PER>Ron</PER> dived for a large chocolate gateau.
“More of the same, really ... advising us all to unite in  the face of our enemies, you know.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> mentioned <PER>Voldemort</PER> at all?”   “Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for  after the feast, doesn’t he?
It can’t be long now.”   “<PER>Snape</PER> said <PER>Hagrid</PER> was late for the feast — ”   “You’ve seen <PER>Snape</PER>?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> was only a few minutes late,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look, he’s waving at you, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the staff table and grinned at  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was indeed waving at him.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had  never quite managed to comport himself with the       dignity of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Head of Gryffindor  House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere  between <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s elbow and shoulder as they were  sitting side by side, and who was looking  disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting.
<PER>Harry</PER>  was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor  Trelawney, sitting on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s other side; she rarely  left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the  start-of-term feast before.
Having  always considered her a bit of a fraud, <PER>Harry</PER> had  been shocked to discover at the end of the previous  term that it had been she who had made the  prediction that caused Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> to kill <PER>Harry</PER>’s  parents and attack <PER>Harry</PER> himself.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was miming  the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and  applause.
“People were interrogating us about it on the train,  weren’t they, <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s right hand was as blackened and dead-  looking as it had been on the night he had come to  fetch <PER>Harry</PER> from the <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
Another year full of magical education  awaits you ...”       “His hand was like that when I saw him over the  summer,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Potions?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, turning  to stare at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But you said — ”   “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, meanwhile,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  raising his voice so that it carried over all the         muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense  Against the Dark Arts teacher.”     “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, so loudly that many heads turned in  his direction.
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, you said that Slughorn was going to be  teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I thought he was!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, racking his brains to  remember when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told him this, but  now that he came to think of it, he was unable to  recall <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever telling him what Slughorn  would be teaching.
<PER>Snape</PER>, who was sitting on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s right, did  not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely  raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause  from the Slytherin table, yet <PER>Harry</PER> was sure he could  detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so  much.
“<PER>Snape</PER> ’ll be gone by the end of the year.”   “What do you mean?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shocked and reproachful.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were not the only ones who had been  talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of  conversation at the news that <PER>Snape</PER> had finally  achieved his heart’s desire.
“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER> and his followers are once more at large  and gaining in strength.”   The silence seemed to tauten and strain as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>  was not looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but making his fork  hover in midair with his wand, as though he found  the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the  gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to <PER>Malfoy</PER> to  allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping,  lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his  trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw  ahead of him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had darted ahead to fulfill  her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but  <PER>Ron</PER> remained with <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”         <PER>Harry</PER> had expected <PER>Ron</PER> to be stunned by <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  boasts.
With what <PER>Harry</PER> considered pure  pigheadedness, however, <PER>Ron</PER> was unimpressed.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over his  shoulder to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> shaking his head.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> uses that name,” said <PER>Harry</PER> stubbornly.
“Yeah, well, tha’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, innit?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>  mysteriously.
We were havin’ a  good chat.”   “Really?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking care not to catch <PER>Ron</PER>’s  eye; the last time he had met <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s half-brother, a  vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the  roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of  which he was unable to pronounce properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell  that <PER>Ron</PER> was experiencing the same sinking feeling as  himself.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “she’s not, is she?”   <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head again.
9      THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> met <PER>Hermione</PER> in the common room  before breakfast next morning.
Hoping for some  support for his theory, <PER>Harry</PER> lost no time in telling  <PER>Hermione</PER> what he had overheard <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying on  the Hogwarts Express.
“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson,  wasn’t he?” interjected <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER>  could say anything.
Whole periods when we  can just sit up here and relax.”   “We’re going to need that time for studying, <PER>Ron</PER>!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, as they set off down the corridor.
<PER>Ron</PER> waited for him to  vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s grip.
“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud  giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found <PER>Ron</PER>’s  remark highly amusing.
While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon,  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> about their  embarrassing conversation with <PER>Hagrid</PER> the previous  evening.
?”   Neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> answered; there was no  need.
<PER>Neville</PER> took  a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious  as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked down his application  and then consulted his O.W.L.
I’ve never had the impression that you  particularly enjoyed it.”   <PER>Neville</PER> looked miserable and muttered something  about “my grandmother wants.”   “Hmph,” snorted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It’s high time  your grandmother learned to be proud of the  grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks  she ought to have — particularly after what happened  at the Ministry.”   <PER>Neville</PER> turned very pink and blinked confusedly;  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had never paid him a  compliment before.
“Take Charms,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “and I  shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just  because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is  not necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly at the look  of delighted incredulity on <PER>Neville</PER>’s face, Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> tapped a blank schedule with the tip of      her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his  new classes, to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“So, Potter, Potter ...” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  consulting her notes as she turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Do you wish to proceed with  Potions?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but I didn’t buy the books or any  ingredients or anything — ”         “I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you  some,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
I shall pass the list to you  in due course and you can fix up trials at your  leisure.”   A few minutes later, <PER>Ron</PER> was cleared to do the same  subjects as <PER>Harry</PER>, and the two of them left the table  together.
“Look,” said <PER>Ron</PER> delightedly, gazing at his schedule,  “we’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after  break ... and after lunch ... excellent.”   They returned to the common room, which was empty  apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie  Bell, the only remaining member of the original  Gryffindor Quidditch team that <PER>Harry</PER> had joined in  his first year.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked a little uncomfortable and began playing  with the Fanged Frisbee <PER>Hermione</PER> had taken from the  fourth-year student.
“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said  anxiously, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined her.
“I bet <PER>Snape</PER> gives us  loads.”   The classroom door opened as she spoke, and <PER>Snape</PER>  stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as  ever by two curtains of greasy black hair.
“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said  <PER>Snape</PER>, closing the door and moving to face the class  from behind his desk; <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily dropped her       copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag  and stowed it under her chair.
“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I  believe.”   You believe ... like you haven’t watched them all come  and go, <PER>Snape</PER>, hoping you’d be next, thought <PER>Harry</PER>  scathingly.
You are fighting that which is unfixed,  mutating, indestructible.”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> took his  time looking around at everybody else, making sure  he had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well —  Miss Granger?”   “Your adversary has no warning about what kind of  magic you’re about to perform,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,   “which gives you a split-second advantage.”         “An answer copied almost word for word from The  Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said <PER>Snape</PER>  dismissively (over in the corner, <PER>Malfoy</PER> sniggered),  “but correct in essentials.
Not all  wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of  concentration and mind power which some” — his  gaze lingered maliciously upon <PER>Harry</PER> once more —  “lack.”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Snape</PER> was thinking of their disastrous  Occlumency lessons of the previous year.
He refused  to drop his gaze, but glowered at <PER>Snape</PER> until <PER>Snape</PER>  looked away.
Carry on.”   Although <PER>Snape</PER> did not know it, <PER>Harry</PER> had taught at  least half the class (everyone who had been a member  of the D.A.)
Typically, ten minutes into the lesson <PER>Hermione</PER>  managed to repel <PER>Neville</PER>’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx  without uttering a single word, a feat that would  surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor  from any reasonable teacher, thought <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly,  but which <PER>Snape</PER> ignored.
He swept between them as  they practiced, looking just as much like an  overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> struggling with the task.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who was supposed to be jinxing <PER>Harry</PER>, was  purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save  himself from the temptation of muttering the  incantation.
“Here  — let me show you — ”   He turned his wand on <PER>Harry</PER> so fast that <PER>Harry</PER>  reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells  forgotten, he yelled, “Protegol”   His Shield Charm was so strong <PER>Snape</PER> was knocked  off-balance and hit a desk.
Behind <PER>Snape</PER>, however, <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and  Seamus grinned appreciatively.
’ ”   “That was brilliant, <PER>Harry</PER>!” chortled <PER>Ron</PER>, once they  were safely on their way to break a short while later.
“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  frowning at <PER>Ron</PER>.
All  that unfixed, indestructible stuff — ”   “Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “I thought he sounded a bit  like you.”   “Like me?”   “Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters  on last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was  hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.
Leaving  Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, unrolling the parchment as he went.
“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had read the  message over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and was looking  perplexed.
I won’t be able to do his  detention!”   He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent the whole of break  speculating on what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would teach <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> said such things were illegal, and  thought it much more likely that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted  to teach <PER>Harry</PER> advanced Defensive magic.
After  break, she went off to Arithmancy while <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the common room, where they  grudgingly started <PER>Snape</PER>’s homework.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand  as <PER>Harry</PER> approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in  Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning.
lags ... And how are you, <PER>Ron</PER>  — <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon  door opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of  the door.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling  cauldrons.
This left <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> to share a table with Ernie.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, m’boy?”   “I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s  <PER>Ron</PER> — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the  N.E.W.T., you see — ”   “Ah, yes, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did mention ... not to  worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all.
...”   Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after  a moment’s foraging, emerged with two very battered-  looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius  Borage, which he gave to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> along with  two sets of tarnished scales.
<PER>Harry</PER> too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike  substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent  <PER>Hermione</PER> getting the credit for answering the  question; she, after all, was the one who had  succeeded in making it, back in their second year.
I’m Muggle-born, you see.”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> lean close to Nott and whisper  something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn  showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and  looked from <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, who was sitting next  to her.
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and  she’s the best in our yeah’ I’m assuming this is the  very friend of whom you spoke, <PER>Harry</PER>?”       “Yes, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> looked rather as he had done the time  <PER>Hermione</PER> had punched him in the face.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  turned to <PER>Harry</PER> with a radiant expression and  whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the  year?
Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered  <PER>Ron</PER>, who for some reason looked annoyed.
I take it,” he  turned, smiling, to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had let out  an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis  does, Miss Granger?”   “It’s liquid luck,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
Now all <PER>Harry</PER> could see of <PER>Malfoy</PER> was the back of his  sleek blond head, because he was at last giving  Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> riffling feverishly  through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas  <PER>Malfoy</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked up; Slughorn was just passing the  Slytherin table.
He could tell that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had  expected to be treated like <PER>Harry</PER> or Zabini; perhaps  even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type  he had learned to expect from <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
At last he reached  the table where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Ernie  were sitting.
Here you are, then, here  you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and  use it well!”   <PER>Harry</PER> slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his  inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at  the furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at  the disappointed expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
“Got lucky, I suppose,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Malfoy</PER>  was within earshot.
It’s just an old  textbook someone’s scribbled on.”   “But you’re doing what it says?”   “I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins,  honestly, <PER>Ginny</PER>, there’s nothing funny — ”   “<PER>Ginny</PER>’s got a point,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, perking up at  once.
10      THE HOUSE OF GAUNT   For the rest of the week’s Potions lessons <PER>Harry</PER>  continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s  instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius  Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson  Slughorn was raving about <PER>Harry</PER>’s abilities, saying  that he had rarely taught anyone so talented.
Neither  <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> was delighted by this.
Although  <PER>Harry</PER> had offered to share his book with both of  them, <PER>Ron</PER> had more difficulty deciphering the  handwriting than <PER>Harry</PER> did, and could not keep  asking <PER>Harry</PER> to read aloud or it might look  suspicious.
“Or herself,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably, overhearing  <PER>Harry</PER> pointing some of these out to <PER>Ron</PER> in the  common room on Saturday evening.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Ooooh!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at once.
We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches  you!”   “Hope it goes okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and the pair of them  watched <PER>Harry</PER> leave through the portrait hole.
“Acid Pops,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and the gargoyle leapt aside;  the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral  stone staircase was revealed, onto which <PER>Harry</PER>  stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up  to the door with the brass knocker that led to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
“You must have been busy, a detention under your  belt already!”       “Er,” began <PER>Harry</PER> awkwardly, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did  not look too stern.
“I have arranged with Professor <PER>Snape</PER> that you will  do your detention next Saturday instead.”   “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had more pressing matters  on his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked  around surreptitiously for some indication of what  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was planning to do with him this  evening.
The circular office looked just as it always  did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-  legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of  previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in  their frames, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s magnificent phoenix,  Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching  <PER>Harry</PER> with bright interest.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a businesslike voice.
From here on in,   <PER>Harry</PER>, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey  Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese  cauldron.”   “But you think you’re right?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
survive?”   “It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as casually as if <PER>Harry</PER> had asked him  about the next day’s weather, “and I certainly hope  that it will help you to survive.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to his feet and walked around the  desk, past <PER>Harry</PER>, who turned eagerly in his seat to  watch <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bending over the cabinet beside  the door.
If you will stand, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was having difficulty pulling out the  stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed  stiff and painful.
“Shall — shall I, sir?”   “No matter, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pointed his wand at the bottle and the  cork flew out.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lengthened his  stride, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried to keep up.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed him onto a narrow  dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows  than those they had left behind.
Sure enough, the  track soon opened up at the copse, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  and <PER>Harry</PER> came to a halt behind Ogden, who had  stopped and drawn his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the  stranger was making himself very clear in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in  one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the  other.
“You understand him, I’m sure, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> indicated that they  ought to follow and <PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, Merope ’s screams  echoing in his ears.
“I think that will do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  at once, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lit extra lamps with a flick of  his wand.
“Merope, or whatever her name was?”       “Oh, she survived,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, reseating  himself behind his desk and indicating that <PER>Harry</PER>  should sit down too.
“I am glad to see you’re keeping up.”   “That old man was — ?”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s grandfather, yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He, as you saw, was left in squalor  and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic  amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of  family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as  his son, and rather more than his daughter.”   “So Merope,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, leaning forward in his chair  and staring at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “so Merope was ... Sir,  does that mean she was ... <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mother?”         “It does,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Wasn’t  <PER>Voldemort</PER> brought up in an orphanage?”   “Yes, indeed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I think that will do for tonight, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> after a moment or two.
“Sir ... is it important to know all this about  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s past?”   “Very important, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Sir, am I allowed to  tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything you’ve told me?”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered him for a moment, then said,  “Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have  proved themselves trustworthy.
It would not be a good idea if word got  around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s secrets.”   “No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“A  few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt  and uncle’s, in fact.”   “That would be around the time you injured your  hand, then, sir?”   “Around that time, yes, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
Good night.”   “Good night, sir.”           HERMIONE’S HELPING HAND   As <PER>Hermione</PER> had predicted, the sixth years’ free  periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation <PER>Ron</PER>  had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to  keep up with the vast amount of homework they were  being set.
<PER>Harry</PER>  barely understood half of what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  said to them these days; even <PER>Hermione</PER> had had to  ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s increasing resentment,  <PER>Harry</PER>’s best subject had suddenly become Potions,  thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic  hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had so far been unable to find  time to go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“We’ve got to go and explain,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking  up at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the  following Saturday at breakfast.
You didn’t hear him going on about  his gormless brother — we’d have been teaching  Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.”   “I hate not talking to <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking  upset.
He too was missing <PER>Hagrid</PER>, although like <PER>Ron</PER> he  thought that they were better off without Grawp in       their lives.
“I dunno why the team’s this popular all of  a sudden.”   “Oh, come on, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, suddenly  impatient.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  spared him one look of disdain before turning back to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot  over the summer either,” <PER>Hermione</PER> finished, ignoring  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Anyone we know dead?” asked <PER>Ron</PER> in a determinedly  casual voice; he posed the same question every time  <PER>Hermione</PER> opened her paper.
Her father picked her up last night.”   “What!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, goggling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
We’ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells,  and we’ve got <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> very quietly, glancing toward the staff table  over the top of the Prophet “Haven’t you noticed?
His  seat’s been empty as often as <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s this past  week.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at the staff table.
Now <PER>Harry</PER>  came to think of it, he had not seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  since their private lesson a week ago.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> did not answer, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that  they were all thinking the same thing.
Remembering what  <PER>Hermione</PER> had said about the Patil twins’ parents  wanting them to leave Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> was  unsurprised to see that the two best friends were  whispering together, looking distressed.
What did  surprise him was that when <PER>Ron</PER> drew level with  them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked  around and gave <PER>Ron</PER> a wide smile.
<PER>Harry</PER>  resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that  <PER>Ron</PER> had refrained from doing so after <PER>Malfoy</PER> had  broken <PER>Harry</PER>’s nose; <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, looked cold  and distant all the way down to the stadium through  the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in  the stands without wishing <PER>Ron</PER> good luck.
After two hours, many complaints, and several  tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty  and several broken teeth, <PER>Harry</PER> had found himself  three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after  an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins,  who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and  <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, who had outflown all the competition  and scored seventeen goals to boot.
<PER>Harry</PER>  glanced over at <PER>Ron</PER>, who had always had a problem  with nerves; <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped that winning their final  match last term might have cured it, but apparently  not: <PER>Ron</PER> was a delicate shade of green.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around, expecting to see  <PER>Hermione</PER>, but it was Lavender Brown.
Delighted, and  resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with  difficulty, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to McLaggen to tell him that,  most unfortunately, <PER>Ron</PER> had beaten him, only to find  McLaggen’s red face inches from his own.
“You flew really well — ”   “You did brilliantly, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   This time it really was <PER>Hermione</PER> running toward  them from the stands; <PER>Harry</PER> saw Lavender walking  off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather  grumpy expression on her face.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked extremely  pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he  grinned at the team and at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the  following Thursday, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> bade  good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off  toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt extremely hungry; he hoped there  would be something to eat at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
...”   To <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned a very deep  shade of pink at these words.
It’s  yeh lot.”   Fang was jumping up at <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>,  attempting to lick their ears.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding shocked.
“Stand back — ”   But before he could say anything else, the door flew  open again as <PER>Harry</PER> had known it would, and there  stood <PER>Hagrid</PER>, glowering down at him and looking,  despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
<PER>Hermione</PER> scurried in after <PER>Harry</PER>, looking rather  frightened.
“Well?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> grumpily, as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down around his enormous wooden  table, Fang laying his head immediately upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s  knee and drooling all over his robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hungry enough even for  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cooking, and took one at once.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> timidly, when he joined them  at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a  brutality that suggested that each tuber had done         him a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to  carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.”     <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave another great snort.
There was a funny squelching sound and they all  looked around: <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a tiny shriek, and  <PER>Ron</PER> leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table  away from the large barrel standing in the corner that  they had only just noticed.
“What are they, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sound  interested rather than revolted, but putting down his  rock cake all the same.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, leaping up, hurrying  around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of  maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking  shoulders.
...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> patted <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s shoulder, looking at a  complete loss for anything to say.
He had known <PER>Hagrid</PER> to present a vicious  baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over  giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to  reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this  was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his  monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog,  who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which  he and <PER>Ron</PER> had only narrowly escaped four years  previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” <PER>Hermione</PER>  asked, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>’s frantic grimaces and head-  shakings.
“I don’ think there is, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” choked <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  attempting to stem the flood of his tears.
...”   After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for  although neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> had shown any  inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous,       gargantuan spider, <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to take it for  granted that they would have liked to have done and  became his usual self once more.
... I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know —  I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ Aragog ... an’ I did wonder  whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin’  yeh   At which all three of them stated categorically and  untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had  substituted for <PER>Hagrid</PER> a few times, was a dreadful  teacher, with the result that by the time <PER>Hagrid</PER> waved  them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite  cheerful.
<PER>Ron</PER> merely guffawed  gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but  <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s arm and held her back.
“But you  should have heard the way he was talking about <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Ginny</PER>!
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, and  they hurried after <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, just the man I was hoping to see!” he  boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus  mustache and puffing out his enormous belly.
“He’s got no chance of persuading <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  the moment Slughorn was out of earshot.
“This  detention’s already been postponed once; <PER>Snape</PER> did it  for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but he won’t do it for anyone else.”   “Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my  own!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that she  was thinking about McLaggen.
“I doubt you’ll be alone, <PER>Ginny</PER>’ll probably be invited,”  snapped <PER>Ron</PER>, who did not seem to have taken kindly  to being ignored by Slughorn.
“Oh, look, your  dad’s in here, <PER>Ron</PER> — he’s all right!” she added  quickly, for <PER>Ron</PER> had looked around in alarm.
Well, if it’s not at their house, he must  have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — ”   “But how can he have done, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  putting down the newspaper with a surprised look.
So you see, <PER>Malfoy</PER> can’t  have brought in anything dangerous!”   Momentarily stymied, <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley  playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before  seeing a way around this objection.
“Can you think of any way <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ?”   “Oh, drop it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited <PER>Hermione</PER>  and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to  go, you know!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, firing up.
“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  getting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.”   He stomped off toward the door to the boys’  dormitories, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> staring after  him.
He rarely appeared at meals  anymore, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Hermione</PER> was right in  thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a  time.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> forgotten the lessons he was  supposed to be giving <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said  that the lessons were leading to something to do with  the prophecy; <PER>Harry</PER> had felt bolstered, comforted,  and now he felt slightly abandoned.
He did not usually lie in bed reading his  textbooks; that sort of behavior, as <PER>Ron</PER> rightly said,  was indecent in anybody except <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was  simply weird that way.
The more <PER>Harry</PER> pored  over the book, the more he realized how much was in  there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on  potions that were earning him such a glowing  reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative  little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which  <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, judging by the crossings-out and  revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.
The only person who did not find these  charms amusing was <PER>Hermione</PER>, who maintained a  rigidly disapproving expression throughout and  refused to talk at all if <PER>Harry</PER> had used the Muffliato  spell on anyone in the vicinity.
There were many crossings-out and  alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the  page, the scribble:   Levicorpus (nvbl)       While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the  windows, and <PER>Neville</PER> snored loudly, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at  the letters in brackets.
Nvbl ... that had to mean  “nonverbal.” <PER>Harry</PER> rather doubted he would be able  to bring off this particular spell; he was still having  difficulty with nonverbal spells, something <PER>Snape</PER> had  been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER> sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in  panic; <PER>Ron</PER> was dangling upside down in midair as  though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the  ankle.
“Sorry!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, as Dean and Seamus roared  with laughter, and <PER>Neville</PER> picked himself up from the  floor, having fallen out of bed.
“Tomorrow,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a muffled voice, “I’d rather  you set the alarm clock.”   By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves  out with several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted  sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves,  <PER>Ron</PER>’s shock had subsided and he had decided that  <PER>Harry</PER>’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in  fact, that he lost no time in regaling <PER>Hermione</PER> with  the story as they sat down for breakfast.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not cracked a smile during this  anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry  disapproval upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And also,” she added, as       <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting  to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”     Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shouted her down at once.
“Just a laugh, <PER>Hermione</PER>, that’s  all!”   “Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“I — Lupin told  me.”   This last part was not true; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen  his father use the spell on <PER>Snape</PER>, but he had never  told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about that particular  excursion into the Pensieve.
“Maybe your dad did use it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  “but he’s not the only one.
You don’t like the Prince, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” he added,  pointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s better  than you at Potions — ”   “It’s got nothing to do with that!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her  cheeks reddening.
It’s only Muggle-borns they  hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and <PER>Ron</PER> join  up.”   “There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said  <PER>Ron</PER> indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he  was now brandishing at <PER>Hermione</PER> and hitting Ernie  Macmillan on the head.
This made <PER>Ron</PER> laugh; even <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a grudging  smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m supposed to give you this.”   It was a scroll of parchment with <PER>Harry</PER>’s name  written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.
“Thanks, <PER>Ginny</PER> ... It’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s next lesson!”  <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling open the  parchment and quickly reading its contents.
More than once <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether  they might not have had a better time in the warm  common room, and when they finally reached  Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had  been boarded up, <PER>Harry</PER> took it as confirmation that  this trip was not destined to be fun.
<PER>Ron</PER> pointed, with  a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was  mercifully open, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> staggered  in his wake into the crowded shop.
Miss  Granger loves them, don’t you?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> helplessly, “they’re really — ”   “So why don’t you come along, <PER>Harry</PER>?” demanded  Slughorn.
This strategy meant that       <PER>Ron</PER> was not left out, and they usually had a laugh  with <PER>Ginny</PER>, imagining <PER>Hermione</PER> shut up with  McLaggen and Zabini.
“Ah,  well ... you can’t evade me forever, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop,  taking as little notice of <PER>Ron</PER> as though he had been a  display of Cockroach Clusters.
“Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those  would last hours!”   Glad that <PER>Hermione</PER> had changed the subject, <PER>Harry</PER>  showed much more interest in the new extra-large  sugar quills than he would normally have done, but  <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look moody and merely shrugged  when <PER>Hermione</PER> asked him where he wanted to go  next.
As <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> drew closer, the barman drew his  cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away,  leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in  his arms.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I — no — ”   “Give it to me!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you mustn’t!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as  Mundungus started to turn blue.
The moment he was inside, <PER>Harry</PER> burst out, “He was  nicking Sirius’s stuff.”   “I know, <PER>Harry</PER>, but please don’t shout, people are  staring,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Go and sit down, I’ll  get you a drink.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was still fuming when <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to  their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of  butterbeer.
“Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s  not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?”   “Shh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately, looking around to  make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple  of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at <PER>Harry</PER>  with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a  pillar not far away.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’d be annoyed too, I know  it’s your things he’s stealing — ”       <PER>Harry</PER> gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily  forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld  Place.
Well, I’m going to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares  Mundungus.”   “Good idea,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, clearly pleased that  <PER>Harry</PER> was calming down.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, what are you staring  at?”   “Nothing,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hastily looking away from the  bar, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew he was trying to catch the eye of  the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta,  for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
<PER>Hermione</PER> drummed her  fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between <PER>Ron</PER>  and the bar.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts  strayed to <PER>Ginny</PER> as they trudged up the road to  Hogwarts through the frozen slush.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> rushed forward to help,  but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she fell on top  of them; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> managed to catch her but she  was writhing so much they could hardly hold her.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had sleet trapped in his  eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great,  shaggy beaverskin coat.
“Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s  cornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or  something — ”   “Wha?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, bending lower to hear what  <PER>Harry</PER> was saying over the raging wind.
It took them  no time to find the little group of people around Katie,  who was still writhing and screaming on the ground;         <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne were all trying to quiet  her.
<PER>Ron</PER> bent down, his hand outstretched, but  <PER>Harry</PER> seized his arm and pulled him back.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf  from around his face and, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>’s gasp,  carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.
As they followed <PER>Hermione</PER> and Leanne up the road,  <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking furiously.
He remembered it and he went back for  it!”     “I — I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hesitantly.
“Loads of  people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and didn’t that girl  say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?”   “She said she came back from the bathroom with it,  she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ”   “<PER>McGonagall</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> warningly.
“Good lord,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, looking  alarmed as she took the necklace from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Take this necklace  to Professor <PER>Snape</PER> at once, but be sure not to touch  it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!”   <PER>Harry</PER> and the others followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  upstairs and into her office.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed the door and swept  around her desk to face <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  the still sobbing Leanne.
“All right,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, not unkindly,  “go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get  Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.”   When she had left the room, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>  turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?”   “She rose up in the air,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before either <PER>Ron</PER>  or <PER>Hermione</PER> could speak, “and then began to scream,  and collapsed.
Professor, can I see Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, please?”   “The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, looking surprised.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> did not invite confidences; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed       less likely to scorn a theory, however wild.
“I think <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave Katie that necklace,  Professor.”   On one side of him, <PER>Ron</PER> rubbed his nose in apparent  embarrassment; on the other, <PER>Hermione</PER> shuffled her  feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance  between herself and <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do you  have any proof?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but ...” and he told her about  following <PER>Malfoy</PER> to Borgin and Burkes and the  conversation they had overheard between him and  Mr. Borgin.
But  that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought  something at the same time, and I think it was that  necklace — ”   “You saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> leaving the shop with a similar  package?”   “No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop  for him — ”         “But <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> interrupted, “Borgin asked  him if he wanted to take it with him, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> said     no —        “Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said  <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> despairingly, “it would be  all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and  quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see  it!
And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say  it was already sold or anything — ”   “Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what  you were up to within about five seconds, of course  he wasn’t going to tell you — anyway, <PER>Malfoy</PER> could’ve  sent off for it since — ”   “That’s enough!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, as  <PER>Hermione</PER> opened her mouth to retort, looking  furious.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was not in  Hogsmeade today.”   <PER>Harry</PER> gaped at her, deflating.
<PER>Harry</PER> was angry with the other two for siding with  <PER>McGonagall</PER>; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in  once they started discussing what had happened.
Or  Slughorn — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons <PER>Voldemort</PER> really  wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided  with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I  wonder why <PER>Malfoy</PER> told her to take it into the castle?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER> wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  actually stamping her foot in frustration.
“Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another  Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than  Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks that plainly said  There’s no point arguing with him.
Not what you’d call foolproof.”   “You’re right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, prodding <PER>Ron</PER> out of the  chair with her foot and offering it to the first year  again.
“It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.”   “But since when has <PER>Malfoy</PER> been one of the world’s  great thinkers?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> answered him.
THE SECRET RIDDLE   Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for  Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by  which time the news that she had been cursed had  spread all over the school, though the details were  confused and nobody other than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie  herself had not been the intended target.
“Oh, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> knows, of course,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who continued their new policy of  feigning deafness whenever <PER>Harry</PER> mentioned his  <PER>Malfoy</PER>-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
<PER>Harry</PER> had wondered whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would  return from wherever he had been in time for Monday  night’s lesson, but having had no word to the  contrary, he presented himself outside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter.
There sat <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looking unusually tired; his  hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled  when he gestured to <PER>Harry</PER> to sit down.
Luckily Professor <PER>Snape</PER> was able  to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse —     “Why him?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> knows much more about  the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tentatively, “I met Mundungus in  Hogsmeade.”   “Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has  been treating your inheritance with light-fingered  contempt,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, frowning a little.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, after a short pause, “did  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> tell you what I told her after  Katie got hurt?
About <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?”   “She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“But what concerns me  now, <PER>Harry</PER>, is our lesson.”       <PER>Harry</PER> felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons  were so very important, why had there been such a  long gap between the first and second?
However, he  said no more about <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but watched as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> poured the fresh memories into the  Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once  more between his long-fingered hands.
Merope was left alone in London,  expecting the baby who would one day become Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   “How do you know she was in London, sir?”   “Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “who, by an odd coincidence,  helped found the very shop whence came the  necklace we have just been discussing.”   He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as <PER>Harry</PER> had  seen him swill them before, much as a gold  prospector sifts for gold.
“Could you possibly  be feeling sorry for Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”         “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t  she, not like my mother — ”   “Your mother had a choice too,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  gently.
And now, if you will stand ...”   “Where are we going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  joined him at the front of the desk.
After you, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool  surface of the memory and then he was falling  through darkness again.
“Nice suit, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before he could stop  himself, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely chuckled as they  followed his younger self a short distance, finally  passing through a set of iron gates into a bare  courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building      surrounded by high railings.
<PER>Harry</PER> and the older <PER>Dumbledore</PER> followed.
Apparently <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  thought so too, for <PER>Harry</PER> now saw him slip his wand  out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time  picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs.  Cole’s desktop.
Nasty things ...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not press her, though <PER>Harry</PER> could  tell that he was interested.
He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll  let him do it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and the two <PER>Dumbledore</PER>s entered the room,  and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them.
I meant — please, Professor,  could you show me — ?”         <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to refuse,  that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time  for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they  were currently in a building full of Muggles and must  therefore be cautious.
When he  had finished, he turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and said  baldly, “I haven’t got any money.”   “That is easily remedied,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, drawing a  leather money-pouch from his pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would insist upon  accompanying Riddle, but once again he was  surprised.
I shall see you at Hogwarts.”   “I think that will do,” said the white-haired  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at <PER>Harry</PER>’s side, and seconds later, they  were soaring weightlessly through darkness once  more, before landing squarely in the present-day  office.
“Sit down,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, landing beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I  didn’t believe <PER>Hagrid</PER> at first, when he told me.”   “Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was  — to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for <PER>Harry</PER> had come to  a halt.
“Very astute, <PER>Harry</PER>, but the mouth organ was only  ever a mouth organ.”       And on that enigmatic note he waved to <PER>Harry</PER>, who  understood himself to be dismissed.
He had been unable to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> about his lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over  breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled  them in as they walked across the vegetable patch  toward the greenhouses.
“You’re  lagging behind, everybody else has started, and  <PER>Neville</PER>’s already got his first pod!”   They looked around; sure enough, there sat <PER>Neville</PER>  with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along  the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly  pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.
“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  adding quietly, when she had turned away again,  “should’ve used Muffliato, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “No, we shouldn’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, looking, as  she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the         Half-Blood Prince and his spells.
One tangled itself in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hair, and <PER>Ron</PER> beat it  back with a pair of secateurs; <PER>Harry</PER> succeeded in  trapping a couple of vines and knotting them  together; a hole opened in the middle of all the  tentaclelike branches; <PER>Hermione</PER> plunged her arm  bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around  her elbow; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tugged and wrenched at  the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched her arm free, clutching in her  fingers a pod just like <PER>Neville</PER>’s.
“Pass me a bowl,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding the  pulsating pod at arm’s length; <PER>Harry</PER> handed one over  and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust  on her face.
“Anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, continuing their  interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood  had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have  a Christmas party, <PER>Harry</PER>, and there’s no way you’ll be       able to wriggle out of this one because he actually  asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be  sure to have it on a night you can come.”   <PER>Harry</PER> groaned.
Meanwhile, <PER>Ron</PER>, who was attempting  to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on  it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could,  said angrily, “And this is another party just for  Slughorn’s favorites, is it?”   “Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to retrieve the pod; when he  got back, <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying, “Look, / didn’t make  up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ”   “ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated <PER>Ron</PER> with a sneer worthy of  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen,  then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug —     “We’re allowed to bring guests,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who  for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet,  “and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think  it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!”   <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly wished the pod had flown a little  farther, so that he need not have been sitting here  with the pair of them.
The  crash, however, appeared to have awoken <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>’s presence.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked  flustered and immediately started fussing about for  her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out  the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; <PER>Ron</PER>, on the  other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased  with himself.
“Hand that over, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hurriedly.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> passed her the pod in the bowl; he and <PER>Ron</PER>  both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and  dived, once more, for the stump.
He and Cho were now too  embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to  each other; what if <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> started going  out together, then split up?
“Gotcha!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling a second pod from the  stump just as <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to burst the first  one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling  like pale green worms.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> watched his two  friends more closely over the next few days, <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> did not seem any different except that they  were a little politer to each other than usual.
Blimey, I can’t  wait to tell <PER>Ginny</PER>!”   He sprinted out of the room, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and  Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment  made no easier when a bird dropping landed on  Seamus’s head as one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s canaries whizzed  over them.
...       <PER>Harry</PER> had no reason to regret his choice once he saw  Dean fly that evening; he worked well with <PER>Ginny</PER> and  Demelza.
<PER>Harry</PER> had known all along that <PER>Ron</PER> was an  inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a  lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming  prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to  have brought out all his old insecurities.
“You prat, <PER>Ron</PER>,  look at the state of her!”   “I can fix that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, landing beside the two  girls, pointing his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and  saying “Episkey.” “And <PER>Ginny</PER>, don’t call <PER>Ron</PER> a prat,  you’re not the Captain of this team — ”   “Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I  thought someone should — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> forced himself not to laugh.
“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a  hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
When <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the tapestry to  take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower,  however, they found themselves looking at Dean and  <PER>Ginny</PER>, who were locked in a close embrace and  kissing fiercely as though glued together.
He gave <PER>Harry</PER> a  shifty grin that <PER>Harry</PER> did not return, as the newborn  monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant  dismissal from the team.
“Right,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, tossing her long red hair out of  her face and glaring at <PER>Ron</PER>, “let’s get this straight  once and for all.
It is none of your business who I go  out with or what I do with them, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “Yeah, it is!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, just as angrily.
“A what,  exactly?”   “He doesn’t mean anything, <PER>Ginny</PER> — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>  automatically, though the monster was roaring its  approval of <PER>Ron</PER>’s words.
If you went out  and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t  mind so much that everyone else does it!”   <PER>Ron</PER> had pulled out his wand too; <PER>Harry</PER> stepped  swiftly between them.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” <PER>Ron</PER>  roared, trying to get a clear shot at <PER>Ginny</PER> around  <PER>Harry</PER>, who was now standing in front of her with his  arms outstretched.
“Just because I don’t do it in  public — !”   <PER>Ginny</PER> screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push  <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way.
Or have you got  a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your  pillow?”   “You—”   A streak of orange light flew under <PER>Harry</PER>’s left arm  and missed <PER>Ginny</PER> by inches; <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Ron</PER> up  against the wall.
“Don’t be stupid — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted <PER>Ginny</PER>, who  sounded close to tears now.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER> snogged  Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something  disgusting, <PER>Ron</PER>, and that’s because you’ve got about  as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”   And with that, she stormed away.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly let go  of <PER>Ron</PER>; the look on his face was murderous.
The monster in his chest purred ... but  then he saw <PER>Ron</PER> ripping open the tapestry curtain  and drawing his wand on <PER>Harry</PER>, shouting things like  “betrayal of trust” .
“D’you think <PER>Hermione</PER> did snog Krum?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked  abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady.
<PER>Harry</PER>  gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination  away from a corridor in which no <PER>Ron</PER> intruded, in  which he and <PER>Ginny</PER> were quite alone —   “What?” he said confusedly.
However, <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to gather the worst from  the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
Neither of them mentioned <PER>Ginny</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> again;  indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening  and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own  thoughts.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay awake for a long time, looking up at the  canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince  himself that his feelings for <PER>Ginny</PER> were entirely elder-  brotherly.
She’s <PER>Ron</PER>’s sister, <PER>Harry</PER> told himself firmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and  confused by a series of dreams in which <PER>Ron</PER> had  chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he  would have happily exchanged the dream <PER>Ron</PER> for the  real one, who was not only cold-shouldering <PER>Ginny</PER>  and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered  <PER>Hermione</PER> with an icy, sneering indifference.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the day attempting to  keep the peace between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with no  success; finally, <PER>Hermione</PER> departed for bed in high  dudgeon, and <PER>Ron</PER> stalked off to the boys’ dormitory      after swearing angrily at several frightened first years  for looking at him.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s dismay, <PER>Ron</PER>’s new aggression did not wear  off over the next few days.
“ENOUGH!” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>, who had seen <PER>Ginny</PER>  glowering in <PER>Ron</PER>’s direction and, remembering her  reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat-  Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got  out of hand.
<PER>Ron</PER> ...” he waited until the rest of the team  were out of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best  mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this  and I’m going to kick you off the team.”   He really thought for a moment that <PER>Ron</PER> might hit  him, but then something much worse happened: <PER>Ron</PER>  seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of  him and he said, “I resign.
I’m pathetic.”   “You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said  <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely, seizing <PER>Ron</PER> by the front of his robes.
He tried  boosting <PER>Ron</PER>’s confidence all through dinner, but <PER>Ron</PER>  was too busy being grumpy and surly with <PER>Hermione</PER>  to notice.
<PER>Harry</PER> persisted in the common room that  evening, but his assertion that the whole team would  be devastated if <PER>Ron</PER> left was somewhat undermined  by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a  huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about  <PER>Ron</PER> and casting him nasty looks.
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> tried  getting angry again in the hope of provoking <PER>Ron</PER> into  a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this  strategy did not appear to work any better than  encouragement; <PER>Ron</PER> went to bed as dejected and  hopeless as ever.
He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only  was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to  beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> at Quidditch even if he could not  yet prove his suspicions about him.
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold,  cheered as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> approached.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned  and waved; <PER>Ron</PER> grimaced weakly and shook his head.
A few minutes later <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had become so  tired of <PER>Ron</PER>’s recent unpleasant behavior that she  had not come down to breakfast with them, paused  on her way up the table.
“Fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was concentrating on handing  <PER>Ron</PER> a glass of pumpkin juice.
Drink up.”   <PER>Ron</PER> had just raised the glass to his lips when  <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke sharply.
“Don’t drink that, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though she  could not believe her eyes.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I warn you, don’t drink it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said  again, alarmed, but <PER>Ron</PER> picked up the glass, drained  it in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around,  <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   She looked scandalized.
“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” <PER>Harry</PER>  asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Conditions look ideal,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
And even better  than that — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gone off sick too!”   “ What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wheeling around to stare at her.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> not playing?”   “Lucky, I call it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking slightly more  animated.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were  leading sixty points to zero, <PER>Ron</PER> having made some  truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his  gloves, and <PER>Ginny</PER> having scored four of Gryffindor’s  six goals.
“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a  Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a  bit more muscle — ”   “Hit a Bludger at him!” <PER>Harry</PER> called to Coote as he  zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to  aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just  passing <PER>Harry</PER> in the opposite direction.
But next moment, his stomach  seemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and  <PER>Harry</PER> was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at  random; he had spotted what <PER>Harry</PER> had not: The  Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting  brightly against the clear blue sky.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, where ’re you going?” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, who had  found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair  hug with the rest of the team, but <PER>Ginny</PER> sped right  on past them until, with an almighty crash, she  collided with the commentator’s podium.
As the  crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team  landed beside the wreckage of wood under which  Zacharias was feebly stirring; <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ginny</PER>  saying blithely to an irate Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.”   Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> broke free of the rest of the team and  hugged <PER>Ginny</PER>, but let go very quickly.
“C’mon, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Demelza!”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> were the last two in the changing  room.
“Yes you did, <PER>Harry</PER>, and that’s why everything went  right, there were Slytherin players missing and <PER>Ron</PER>  saved everything!”   “I didn’t put it in!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning broadly.
“I wanted  <PER>Ron</PER> to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you  were looking.” He looked at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gaped at him for a  moment, then rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>, imitating her  voice.
I can  save goals without help, <PER>Hermione</PER>!”   “I never said you couldn’t — <PER>Ron</PER>, you thought you’d  been given it too!”   But <PER>Ron</PER> had already strode past her out of the door  with his broomstick over his shoulder.
“Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER> into the sudden silence; he had not  expected his plan to backfire like this, “shall ... shall  we go up to the party, then?”   “You go!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, blinking back tears.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly back up the grounds toward the  castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted  congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of  letdown; he had been sure that if <PER>Ron</PER> won the match,  he and <PER>Hermione</PER> would be friends again immediately.
He did not see how he could possibly explain to  <PER>Hermione</PER> that what she had done to offend <PER>Ron</PER> was  kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred  so long ago.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Hermione</PER> at the Gryffindor  celebration party, which was in full swing when he  arrived.
Good game, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   She patted him on the arm; <PER>Harry</PER> felt a swooping  sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to  help herself to more butterbeer.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away from <PER>Ron</PER>, who did not look like he  would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was  closing.
He was just  wondering whether there was any chance that she  had not noticed <PER>Ron</PER>, that she had merely left the  room because the party was a little too rowdy, when  she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “<PER>Ron</PER>  seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”   “Er .
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror,  <PER>Ron</PER> came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.
“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was staring at <PER>Ron</PER>, who refused to look at  her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and  awkwardness, “Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was looking relieved that  nothing worse had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun around to see <PER>Hermione</PER> pointing her  wand at <PER>Ron</PER>, her expression wild: The little flock of  birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets  toward <PER>Ron</PER>, who yelped and covered his face with his  hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at  every bit of flesh they could reach.
Large groups of girls tended to converge  underneath the mistletoe bunches every time <PER>Harry</PER>  went past, which caused blockages in the corridors;  fortunately, however, <PER>Harry</PER>’s frequent nighttime  wanderings had given him an unusually good  knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that  he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate  mistletoe-free routes between classes.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> much preferred this new laughing,        joking <PER>Ron</PER> to the moody, aggressive model he had  been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved  <PER>Ron</PER> came at a heavy price.
Firstly, <PER>Harry</PER> had to put  up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown,  who seemed to regard any moment that she was not  kissing <PER>Ron</PER> as a moment wasted; and secondly,   <PER>Harry</PER> found himself once more the best friend of two  people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each  other again.
<PER>Ron</PER>, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches  and cuts from <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bird attack, was taking a  defensive and resentful tone.
Determined as he was to remain friends with both  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, he was spending a lot of time with  his mouth shut tight.
“I never promised <PER>Hermione</PER> anything,” <PER>Ron</PER> mumbled.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> turned a page of Quintessence, aware that <PER>Ron</PER>  was watching him.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s voice tailed away in mutters,  barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire,  though <PER>Harry</PER> thought he caught the words “Krum”  and “can’t complain” again.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s schedule was so full that <PER>Harry</PER> could only  talk to her properly in the evenings, when <PER>Ron</PER> was, in       any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he  did not notice what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  refused to sit in the common room while <PER>Ron</PER> was  there, so <PER>Harry</PER> generally joined her in the library,  which meant that their conversations were held in  whispers.
“And incidentally,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, after a few  moments, “you need to be careful.”   “For the last time,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, speaking in a slightly  hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of  silence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned  more from the Half-Blood Prince than <PER>Snape</PER> or  Slughorn have taught me in — ”   “I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving his book a nasty look as though  it had been rude to her.
It’s tomorrow night, they’re getting  desperate.”   “There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>,  who was still trying not to think about <PER>Ginny</PER> any  more than he could help, despite the fact that she  kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made  him devoutly thankful that <PER>Ron</PER> could not perform  Legilimency.
So why couldn’t <PER>Malfoy</PER> have brought  the necklace into the school — ?”   “Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ... not that again ...”   “Come on, why not?” demanded <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a  cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt  he can tell one potion from — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead; <PER>Harry</PER> had heard it too.
She looked as though she might have a seizure;  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had hastily packed her things,  grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> by the arm and frogmarched him  away.
“Well, good night, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though it  was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for  the girls’ dormitory without another word.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to bed comforting himself that there was  only one more day of lessons to struggle through,  plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and <PER>Ron</PER> would  depart together for the Burrow.
It now seemed  impossible that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would make up  with each other before the holidays began, but  perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to  calm down, think better of their behavior.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  laughed unkindly at <PER>Ron</PER>’s disastrous first attempt,  during which he somehow managed to give himself a  spectacular handlebar mustache; <PER>Ron</PER> retaliated by  doing a cruel but accurate impression of <PER>Hermione</PER>  jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> asked a question, which Lavender and  Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced  <PER>Hermione</PER> to the verge of tears again.
She raced out of  the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things  behind; <PER>Harry</PER>, deciding that her need was greater  than <PER>Ron</PER>’s just now, scooped up her remaining  possessions and followed her.
“Anyonel And you chose Loony  Lovegood?”   “Don’t call her that, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>, pausing  behind <PER>Harry</PER> on her way to join friends.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to feel pleased that <PER>Ginny</PER> was glad he was  taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage  it.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Ron</PER>  looking at her furtively.
Squeezing herself in  between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, Lavender flung her arms  around <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that she  was feeling guilty for having laughed at <PER>Hermione</PER> in  Transfiguration.
“Hi, Parvati!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER> and  Lavender completely.
“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a  most un-<PER>Hermione</PER>-ish giggle.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as  <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna had squeezed in through the door.
Gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly he  might have been hoping to Disapparate with him,  Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; <PER>Harry</PER>  seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old  student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life  Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend  Sanguini.”   Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man,  grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and shook it enthusiastically;  the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated  with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple,  peering shortsightedly up into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“I was  saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day,  ‘Where is the biography of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter for which we  have all been waiting?’ ”   “Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “were you?”   “Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple.
<PER>Hermione</PER>V’   “<PER>Harry</PER>!
Hi, Luna!”   “What’s happened to you?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, for <PER>Hermione</PER>  looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had  just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare.
“I thought he’d annoy <PER>Ron</PER> most,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  dispassionately.
Under cover of her furious  criticisms of Firenze, <PER>Harry</PER> drew closer to <PER>Hermione</PER>       and said, “Let’s get something straight.
Are you  planning to tell <PER>Ron</PER> that you interfered at Keeper  tryouts?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> raised her eyebrows.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, if you can  ask out McLaggen — ”   “There’s a difference,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with dignity.
“I’ve got no plans to tell <PER>Ron</PER> anything about what  might, or might not, have happened at Keeper  tryouts.”   “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fervently.
I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of  ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus     And to <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm  and seemed to scoop <PER>Snape</PER> out of thin air toward  them.
Some credit must  go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!”   Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders,  <PER>Snape</PER> looked down his hooked nose at <PER>Harry</PER>, his  black eyes narrowed.
“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson,       Draught of Living Death — never had a student  produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even  you, Severus — ”   “Really?” said <PER>Snape</PER> quietly, his eyes still boring into  <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt a certain disquiet.
Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping  wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to  raise his spirits even higher: <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> being  dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
Just this once,  we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   Filch ’s expression of outraged disappointment was  perfectly predictable; but why, <PER>Harry</PER> wondered,  watching him, did <PER>Malfoy</PER> look almost equally  unhappy?
And why was <PER>Snape</PER> looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> as  though both angry and .
But almost before <PER>Harry</PER> had registered what he had  seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering  under his breath; <PER>Malfoy</PER> had composed his face into  a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity,  and <PER>Snape</PER>’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
It was not the sucking-up that  intrigued him; he had watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> do that to  <PER>Snape</PER> for a long time.
This was the first time he had  seen <PER>Malfoy</PER> close up for ages; he now saw that <PER>Malfoy</PER>  had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly  grayish tinge to his skin.
“I’d like a word with you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>  suddenly.
“Follow me,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   They left, <PER>Snape</PER> leading the way, <PER>Malfoy</PER> looking  resentful.
What was  more difficult was finding <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Perhaps <PER>Snape</PER> had taken <PER>Malfoy</PER> to      his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was  escorting him back to the Slytherin common room.
What thoughts are you trying to conceal from  your master, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?”   “I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just  don’t want you butting in!”   <PER>Harry</PER> pressed his ear still more closely against the  keyhole.
... What had happened to make <PER>Malfoy</PER> speak  to <PER>Snape</PER> like this — <PER>Snape</PER>, toward whom he had  always shown respect, even liking?
Report me to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”  jeered <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Then <PER>Snape</PER> said, “You  know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of  those things.”   “You’d better stop telling me to come to your office  then!”   “Listen to me,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his voice so low now that  <PER>Harry</PER> had to push his ear very hard against the  keyhole to hear.
It’s my job, he gave it to  me and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to  work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it  would!”   “What is your plan?”   “It’s none of your business!”   “If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist  you — ”   “I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not  alone!”   “You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish  in the extreme, wandering the corridors without  lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes —     “I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you  hadn’t put them in detention!”       “Keep your voice down!” spat <PER>Snape</PER>, for <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice  had risen excitedly.
Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts     “It is an act that is crucial to success, <PER>Malfoy</PER>!” said  <PER>Snape</PER>.
I quite understand  that your father’s capture and imprisonment has  upset you, but — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> had barely a second’s warning; he heard  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s footsteps on the other side of the door and  flung himself out of the way just as it burst open;  <PER>Malfoy</PER> was striding away down the corridor, past the  open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant  corner, and out of sight.
Hardly daring to breathe, <PER>Harry</PER> remained crouched  down as <PER>Snape</PER> emerged slowly from the classroom.
He was definitely  offering to help him?”   “If you ask that once more,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I’m going to  stick this sprout — ”   “I’m only checking!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yes, <PER>Snape</PER> was offering to help himl” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He  said he’d promised <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother to protect him,  that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —     “An Unbreakable Vow?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking stunned.
Bless them.”   “I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said  <PER>Ron</PER> grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!”   “But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the  kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, “we can  enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a  — whoops-a-daisy!”   “You made me do that!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily, sucking his  cut thumb.
“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills,   <PER>Ron</PER>ald,” said George, “what is this we hear from  <PER>Ginny</PER> about you and a young lady called — unless  our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?”       <PER>Ron</PER> turned a little pink, but did not look displeased  as he turned back to the sprouts.
“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the attic, and if Fleur shares with  <PER>Ginny</PER> — ”   “ — that’ll make <PER>Ginny</PER>’s Christmas — ” muttered Fred.
“I promised <PER>Dumbledore</PER> I  wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.”       “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
He peeled a few more sprouts  and then said, “Are you going to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what  you heard <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying to each other?”   “Yep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
That was the whole  point, he was refusing to tell <PER>Snape</PER>.”   There was silence for a moment or two, then <PER>Ron</PER>  said, “ ’Course, you know what they’ll all say?
They’ll say <PER>Snape</PER>  isn’t really trying to help <PER>Malfoy</PER>, he was just trying to  find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s up to.”   “They didn’t hear him,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“No one’s  that good an actor, not even <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “Yeah ... I’m just saying, though,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But  they’re all convinced <PER>Snape</PER>’s in the Order, aren’t  they?”   <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
It had already occurred to him  that this would be the most likely objection to his new  evidence; he could hear <PER>Hermione</PER> now: Obviously,  <PER>Harry</PER>, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick  <PER>Malfoy</PER> into telling him what he’s doing.
Still, even <PER>Hermione</PER> would not be able to deny one  thing: <PER>Malfoy</PER> was definitely up to something, and  <PER>Snape</PER> knew it, so <PER>Harry</PER> felt fully justified in saying “I  told you so,” which he had done several times to <PER>Ron</PER>  already.
Fred, George,   <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> were the only ones who knew that the  angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome  that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up  carrots for Christmas dinner.
... Well, something  more ...”   And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard  between <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Has it occurred to you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Mr. Weasley,  “that <PER>Snape</PER> was simply pretending — ?”   “Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out  what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s up to?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts Severus,  and that ought to be good enough for all of us.”   “But,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “just say — just say <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  wrong about <PER>Snape</PER> — ”   “People have said it, many times.
I  do; therefore, I trust Severus.”   “But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> can make mistakes,” argued <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No,  <PER>Harry</PER>, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as <PER>Harry</PER>  pulled a skeptical expression.
I  must be grateful.”   “Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> watching him!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
It might have been on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders that  Severus questioned <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   ... and now you’ve torn it quite apart   I’ll thank you to give back my heart!
<PER>Voldemort</PER> has  threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and  daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good  results.”   Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who  bit me.”   “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, astonished.
“Jinxes go in and out of  fashion like everything else.”   He looked into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and then said quietly,  “James was a pureblood, <PER>Harry</PER>, and I promise you,  he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’ ”   Abandoning pretense, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “And it wasn’t  Sirius?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed all the way up to <PER>Ron</PER>’s attic  bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> fell asleep almost immediately, but <PER>Harry</PER> delved  into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced  Potion-Making before getting into bed.
Feeling disappointed, <PER>Harry</PER> threw the book back into  his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over,  thinking of werewolves and <PER>Snape</PER>, Stan Shunpike  and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an  uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of  bitten children.
You should definitely wear it  in front of Fred and George.”         “If you tell them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shoving the necklace out  of sight under his pillow, “I — I — 111 — ”   “Stutter at me?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
He hesitated a moment, then  said, “Is <PER>Hermione</PER> really going out with McLaggen?”   “I dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> would,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Very  thoughtful.”   “I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  which sobered <PER>Ron</PER> up at once.
“Parsnips, Remus?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>  cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out;         <PER>Harry</PER> felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had  nothing to do with the maggot.
Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense  that he did not know <PER>Harry</PER>’s name convincing, or find  it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the  Minister around the garden when <PER>Ginny</PER>, Fleur, and  George also had clean plates.
Especially what happened at the Ministry     He waited for <PER>Harry</PER> to say something, but <PER>Harry</PER> did  not oblige, so he went on, “I have been hoping for an  occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has — most understandably, as I say —  prevented this.”   Still, <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing, waiting.
I assume that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has discussed these  matters with you?”   <PER>Harry</PER> deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie  or not.
“And what has  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Sorry, but that’s between us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was silent so long that  Scrimgeour said, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to the gnome,  “Funny little chaps, aren’t they?
But what say you,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to  clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression  that I’m working for the Ministry?”   “It would give everyone a lift to think you were more  involved, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved  that <PER>Harry</PER> had cottoned on so quickly.
...”      “But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,”  said <PER>Harry</PER>, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly,  “won’t that seem as though I approve of what the  Ministry’s up to?”   “Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes,  that’s partly why we’d like — ”   “No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said <PER>Harry</PER> pleasantly.
You are sixteen years old     “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t  think Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
You prefer — like your hero, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — to  disassociate yourself from the Ministry?”   “I don’t want to be used,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s man  through and through, aren’t you, Potter?”   “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
A SLUGGISH MEMORY   Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year,  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> lined up beside the kitchen  fire to return to Hogwarts.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> stepped into the emerald fire and shouted  “Hogwarts!” He had one last fleeting view of the  Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face  before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he  caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms,  which were whipped out of sight before he could get a  proper look; then he was slowing down, finally  stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office.
Try not to get too much ash on the  carpet.”   “No, Professor.”   <PER>Harry</PER> straightened his glasses and flattened his hair  as <PER>Ron</PER> came spinning into view.
When <PER>Ginny</PER> had  arrived, all three of them trooped out of <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s  office and off toward Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Ginny</PER>!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced  and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.
“Did you have a good Christmas?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus  Scrim — ”   “I’ve got something for you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  neither looking at <PER>Ron</PER> nor giving any sign that she  had heard him.
“Great,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, unrolling it at once to discover  that his next lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was scheduled  for the following night.
... Coming,  <PER>Ginny</PER>?”   “No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>,  though <PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing that she did not  sound very enthusiastic.
Leaving <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender  locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, <PER>Harry</PER> led  <PER>Hermione</PER> over to the spare table.
So what was this  important news you wanted to tell me?”   She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so  <PER>Harry</PER> dropped the subject of <PER>Ron</PER> and recounted all  that he had overheard between <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
When he had finished, <PER>Hermione</PER> sat in thought for a  moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?”   “ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could  trick <PER>Malfoy</PER> into telling him what he’s doing?”   “Well, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad and Lupin think so,” <PER>Harry</PER> said  grudgingly.
did either of them actually mention  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name?”   <PER>Harry</PER> frowned, trying to remember.
“I’m not sure ...  <PER>Snape</PER> definitely said your master,’ and who else  would that be?”   “I don’t know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, biting her lip.
You know full well I never  listened ...”   “No, no, not History of Magic — <PER>Malfoy</PER> threatened  Borgin with him!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
But this proves <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with  Greyback and telling him what to do?”   “It is pretty suspicious,” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Unless     “Oh, come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in exasperation, “you can’t  get round this one!”   “Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty  threat.”   “You’re unbelievable, you are,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking  his head.
...”   And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both  of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for <PER>Hermione</PER>,  like <PER>Ron</PER>, thought that after all the Ministry had put         <PER>Harry</PER> through the previous year, they had a great  deal of nerve asking him for help now.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined the crowd that was jostling  around the notice and taking it in turns to write their  names at the bottom.
<PER>Ron</PER> was just taking out his  quill to sign after <PER>Hermione</PER> when Lavender crept up  behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and  trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see  <PER>Hermione</PER> stalking off; he caught up with her, having  no wish to stay behind with <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender, but to  his surprise, <PER>Ron</PER> caught up with them only a little  way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and  his expression disgruntled.
Without a word, <PER>Hermione</PER>  sped up to walk with <PER>Neville</PER>.
“So — Apparition,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his tone making it  perfectly plain that <PER>Harry</PER> was not to mention what  had just happened.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s already Apparated,” <PER>Ron</PER> told a slightly  abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried  himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus  lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a  stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him.
It did not seem to have healed at all  and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time,  what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did  not ask; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that he would know  eventually and there was, in any case, another  subject he wanted to discuss.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could  say anything about <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  spoke.
We must try not to sink beneath our  anguish, <PER>Harry</PER>, but battle on.”   <PER>Harry</PER> grinned.
Well, it appears that  Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”   “He accused me of being ‘<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s man through  and through.’ ”   “How very rude of him.”   “I told him I was.”         <PER>Dumbledore</PER> opened his mouth to speak and then  closed it again.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s intense  embarrassment, he suddenly realized that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery,  and stared hastily at his own knees.
“I am very touched, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when  you’re not at Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still looking  fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  now sounding cheerful, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it safe to  look up again.
I have already been forced to jinx  Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.”   “So they still don’t know where you go?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>,  hoping for more information on this intriguing  subject, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely smiled over the top  of his half-moon spectacles.
“It’s about <PER>Malfoy</PER>  and <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Yes, sir.
...”         <PER>Dumbledore</PER> listened to <PER>Harry</PER>’s story with an  impassive face.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished he did not  speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for  telling me this, <PER>Harry</PER>, but I suggest that you put it  out of your mind.
“Professor, did you understand — ?”   “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>, blessed as I am with extraordinary  brainpower, I understood everything you told me,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, a little sharply.
Again, I am glad that you have confided  in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told  me anything that causes me disquiet.”   <PER>Harry</PER> sat in seething silence, glaring at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Did this mean that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had indeed ordered <PER>Snape</PER> to find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>  was doing, in which case he had already heard  everything <PER>Harry</PER> had just told him from <PER>Snape</PER>?
“So, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in what he hoped was a polite,  calm voice, “you definitely still trust — ?”   “I have been tolerant enough to answer that question  already,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but he did not sound very  tolerant anymore.
As  though he had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook  his head.
I chose to give him that chance.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused and looked inquiringly at <PER>Harry</PER>,  who had opened his mouth to speak.
the Riddle who came out of that diary said,       ‘<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never seemed to like me as much as the  other teachers did.’ ”   “Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he  was trustworthy,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And now, <PER>Harry</PER>, if  you will stand ...”         <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rose, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that he was again  holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling,  pearly memory.
There on the threshold,  holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy <PER>Harry</PER>  recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and  handsome — the teenage <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help but feel a resentful  admiration for <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s complete lack of fear.
...       <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s fingers closed tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>’s  arm and they were soaring back into the present  again.
The soft golden light in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office  seemed to dazzle <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes after that impenetrable  darkness.
“Why did it go dark,  what happened?”   “Because Morfin could not remember anything from  that point onward,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER>  back into his seat.
The exception  sits before me,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> added, with a nod to  <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar.
He lived out the remainder of his life in  Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last  heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside  the other poor souls who have expired within its  walls.”   “So <PER>Voldemort</PER> stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting up straight.
Before the Ministry  reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.”   “But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had done all that to Morfin?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked  angrily.
“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an  adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t  know?”   “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed  the magic,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling slightly at the  look of great indignation on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
...”     <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took from an inside pocket another  crystal phial and <PER>Harry</PER> fell silent at once,  remembering that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said it was the  most important one he had collected.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> appeared beside  him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn ’s  office.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Voldemort</PER> at  once.
The whole room was suddenly filled with a  thick white fog, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing but  the face of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who was standing beside  him.
about  Horcruxes?”   And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled  the room so that <PER>Harry</PER> could not see Slughorn or  <PER>Voldemort</PER> at all; only <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling serenely  beside him.
Now get out of here at once and don’t  let me catch you mentioning them again\”   “Well, that’s that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placidly beside  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Time to go.”         And <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later,  back onto the mg in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
“As you might have noticed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has  been tampered with.”   “Tampered with?” repeated <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting back down  too.
“Good night, sir.”   As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly  heard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy  should be able to do it better than you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Fawkes gave another low, musical  cry.
BIRTHDAY SURPRISES   The next day <PER>Harry</PER> confided in both <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> the task that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had set him,  though separately, for <PER>Hermione</PER> still refused to  remain in <PER>Ron</PER>’s presence longer than it took to give  him a contemptuous look.
<PER>Ron</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER> was unlikely to have any  trouble with Slughorn at all.
...”        “You haven’t?” <PER>Harry</PER> was disappointed; he had hoped  that <PER>Hermione</PER> might have been able to give him a  clue as to what Horcruxes were.
“After all, when has Won-  Won’s judgment ever been faulty?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, can’t you — ?”   “iVo!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving  <PER>Harry</PER> alone and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these  days, seeing as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had to  share a desk.
Today, <PER>Hermione</PER> moved her cauldron  around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and  ignored both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’ve you done?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking  at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s haughty profile.
"... which means, of course, that assuming we have  achieved correct identification of the potion’s  ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim  is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes  to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find  that added component that will, by an almost  alchemical process, transform these disparate  elements — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> was sitting beside <PER>Harry</PER> with his mouth half  open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced  Potion-Making.
<PER>Ron</PER> kept forgetting that he could no  longer rely on <PER>Hermione</PER> to help him out of trouble  when he failed to grasp what was going on.
Good luck, and don’t  forget your protective gloves!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> had left her stool and was halfway toward  Slughorn ’s desk before the rest of the class had  realized it was time to move, and by the time <PER>Harry</PER>,       <PER>Ron</PER>, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already  tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and  was kindling a fire underneath it.
He glanced around at  <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now standing there looking rather  gormless, having copied everything <PER>Harry</PER> had done.
“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” <PER>Ron</PER>  muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Ernie Macmillan, however, was  muttering, “Specialis Reveliol” over his cauldron,  which sounded impressive, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  hastened to imitate him.
“A  stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will  protect from most poisons.”   It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and  had <PER>Snape</PER> still been their teacher, <PER>Harry</PER> would not  have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate  measures.
...”   The only person in the room looking angrier than  <PER>Hermione</PER> was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see,  had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over  himself.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER>  wished him luck as they left; both looked rather  annoyed.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, reminding himself irresistibly of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “I wanted to ask you something.”   “Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> was at all sympathetic  when <PER>Harry</PER> told them of this disastrous interview.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was still seething at the way <PER>Harry</PER> had  triumphed without doing the work properly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was  resentful that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
Infuriated by his failure and by <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  attitudes, <PER>Harry</PER> brooded for the next few days over  what to do next about Slughorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> checked with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>:  Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as      far as they knew, had anybody else.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not  help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn  was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply  determined to give <PER>Harry</PER> no additional opportunities  to question him.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived in the Hall (<PER>Ron</PER>  had come down with Lavender), they found that the  tables had disappeared.
Rain lashed against the high  windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly  above them as they assembled in front of Professors      <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout — the  Heads of Houses — and a small wizard whom <PER>Harry</PER>  took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry.
I hope to be able to prepare you for  your Apparition Tests in this time — ”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly at  <PER>Snape</PER>, who also looked annoyed, though <PER>Harry</PER>  strongly suspected that this was less because of  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s rudeness than the fact that <PER>McGonagall</PER> had  reprimanded one of his House.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, where are you going?” demanded <PER>Hermione</PER>.
But <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; he was moving quickly  through the crowd, past the place where Professor  Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a  few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the  front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the  Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie  Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at  the back of the crowd, directly behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who  was taking advantage of the general upheaval to  continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet  away and looking mutinous.
“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” <PER>Malfoy</PER>  shot at him, oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER> standing right behind  him.
“Look, it’s  none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you  and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!”   “I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to  keep a lookout for me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, just loud enough  for <PER>Malfoy</PER> to hear him.
“How did you do?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, hurrying toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  glancing over his shoulder to see where <PER>Malfoy</PER> was,  and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall.
...”   Perplexed, <PER>Ron</PER> followed <PER>Harry</PER> back to the Gryffindor  Tower at a run.
They were temporarily detained by  Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor  shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they  set fire to their own pants, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> simply  turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts.
“<PER>Harry</PER> ...”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts.
“Help me find <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently.
Despite his determination to catch <PER>Malfoy</PER> out, <PER>Harry</PER>  had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks.
<PER>Harry</PER> toyed with the possibility that  <PER>Malfoy</PER> was actually leaving the school grounds, but  could not see how he could be doing it, given the very  high level of security now operating within the castle.
As for the fact that <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle  appeared to be going their different ways when they  were usually inseparable, these things happened as  people got older — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> reflected  sadly, were living proof.
“Happy birthday, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, when they were  woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean  leaving noisily for breakfast.
“Have a present.”   He threw the package across onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed, where it  joined a small pile of them that must, <PER>Harry</PER> assumed,  have been delivered by house-elves in the night.
“Cheers,” said <PER>Ron</PER> drowsily and, as he ripped off the  paper, <PER>Harry</PER> got out of bed, opened his own trunk,  and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map,  which he hid after every use.
“Nice one, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically, waving  the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves <PER>Harry</PER> had  given him.
“No problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER> absentmindedly, as he  searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gone  again!”   “Can’t have done,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, stuffing a second  Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get  dressed.
The best  way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with  the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea:  <PER>Harry</PER> had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework,  and Apparition; he could not follow <PER>Malfoy</PER> around  school all day without his absence being remarked  upon.
“I thought you just said — ?”   “Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed <PER>Ron</PER>,  “but I don’t want to eat.”   <PER>Harry</PER> scrutinized him suspiciously.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly.
“What?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I can’t stand it!”   “You can’t stand what?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, now starting to  feel definitely alarmed.
You’re  joking.”   “I think ... <PER>Harry</PER>, I think I love her,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a  strangled voice.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, walking up to <PER>Ron</PER> to get a better  look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion,  “okay... Say that again with a straight face.”         “I love her,” repeated <PER>Ron</PER> breathlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his  pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without  conscious thought: Levicorpus\   <PER>Ron</PER> yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once  more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes  hanging off him.
Can you introduce me?”   <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the dangling <PER>Ron</PER>, whose face now  looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong  desire to laugh.
But on the other  hand, they were supposed to be friends, <PER>Ron</PER> had not  been himself when he had attacked, and <PER>Harry</PER>  thought that he would deserve another punching if he  permitted <PER>Ron</PER> to declare undying love for Romilda  Vane.
“I’m going to let you down now, okay?”   He sent <PER>Ron</PER> crashing back to the floor (his ear did  hurt quite a lot), but <PER>Ron</PER> simply bounded to his feet  again, grinning.
...”   “Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  as quietly as possible, while <PER>Ron</PER> stood on tiptoe,  attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, “but  my friend <PER>Ron</PER>’s swallowed a love potion by mistake.
“Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, somewhat distracted by the fact that  <PER>Ron</PER> was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt  to force his way into the room, “well, I’ve never mixed  an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get  it right, <PER>Ron</PER> might’ve done something serious — ”   Helpfully, <PER>Ron</PER> chose this moment to moan, “I can’t  see her, <PER>Harry</PER> — is he hiding her?”   “Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now  eyeing <PER>Ron</PER> with professional interest.
“They can  strengthen, you know, the longer they’re kept.”   “That would explain a lot,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, now  positively wrestling with <PER>Ron</PER> to keep him from  knocking Slughorn over.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> burst through the door into Slughorn ’s  overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasseled  footstool, regained his balance by seizing <PER>Harry</PER>  around the neck, and muttered, “She didn’t see that,  did she?”         “She’s not here yet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching Slughorn  opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of  this and that to a small crystal bottle.
“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> a glass of mead each before raising his own.
“Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — and may you have many more — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER>\”   <PER>Ron</PER> had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his  chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking  uncontrollably.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt over a low table and sprinted toward  Slughorn ’s open potion kit, pulling out jars and  pouches, while the terrible sound of <PER>Ron</PER>’s gargling  breath filled the room.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were  sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting  outside the double doors, trying to see inside  whenever somebody went in or out.
“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our  present,” said George grimly, putting down a large  wrapped gift on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bedside cabinet and sitting  beside <PER>Ginny</PER>.
But never  mind that now.”   He drew up a chair beside <PER>Harry</PER> and looked at <PER>Ron</PER>’s  pale face.
“How exactly did it happen, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> retold the story he had already recounted, it felt  like a hundred times to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  to Madam Pomfrey, to <PER>Hermione</PER>, and to <PER>Ginny</PER>.
"... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his  breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help,  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they  brought <PER>Ron</PER> up here.
Having hurtled,  white-faced, up to <PER>Harry</PER> outside the hospital wing  and demanded to know what had happened, she had  taken almost no part in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s obsessive  discussion about how <PER>Ron</PER> had been poisoned, but  merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and      frightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed  in to see him.
“Slughorn poured it out — ”   “Would he have been able to slip something into <PER>Ron</PER>’s  glass without you seeing?”   “Probably,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but why would Slughorn  want to poison <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “No idea,” said Fred, frowning.
Meaning  to get you?”   “Why would Slughorn want to poison <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“The poison  could have been in the bottle, in which case it was  probably meant for Slughorn himself.”   “Who’d want to kill Slughorn?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted Slughorn on  his side,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants  him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be  valuable to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “But you said Slughorn had been planning to give  that bottle to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for Christmas,” <PER>Ginny</PER>  reminded him.
“So the poisoner could just as easily  have been after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, speaking for the first time in hours  and sounding as though she had a bad head cold.
“I don’ believe this,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely, shaking his  great shaggy head as he stared down at <PER>Ron</PER>.
They  had done no more than satisfy themselves that <PER>Ron</PER>  would make a full recovery on their last visit to the  ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of <PER>Harry</PER> and  hugged him very tightly.
You saved <PER>Ginny</PER> ... you  saved Arthur ... now you’ve saved <PER>Ron</PER> ...”   “Don’t be ...
“Well, all I can say is that it was a  lucky day for the Weasleys when <PER>Ron</PER> decided to sit in  your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of any reply to this and was  almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them  that there were only supposed to be six visitors  around <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed; he and <PER>Hermione</PER> rose at once to       leave and <PER>Hagrid</PER> decided to go with them, leaving <PER>Ron</PER>  with his family.
...”   “Hasn’t he got any ideas, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>  desperately.
Wha’ worries me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder  (<PER>Harry</PER>, for good measure, checked the ceiling for  Peeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids  are bein’ attacked.
There’ll be panic, more parents takin’ their  kids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh know the board  o’ governors ...”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired  woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a  hoarse whisper, "... the board o’ governors’ll be talkin’  about shuttin’ us up fer good.”   “Surely not?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking worried.
’S’no wonder <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s angry with Sn —         <PER>Hagrid</PER> stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty  expression on what was visible of his face above his  tangled black beard.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s angry with  <PER>Snape</PER>?”   “I never said tha’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though his look of  panic could not have been a bigger giveaway.
“Look at  the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, why is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> angry with <PER>Snape</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> asked loudly.
“What’s <PER>Snape</PER> done?”   “I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>, I shouldn’ta heard it at all!
Didn’t like ter  draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried  not ter listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion  an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out.”   “Well?” <PER>Harry</PER> urged him, as <PER>Hagrid</PER> shuffled his  enormous feet uneasily.
“Well — I jus’ heard <PER>Snape</PER> sayin’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took  too much fer granted an’ maybe he — <PER>Snape</PER> — didn’  wan’ ter do it anymore — ”   “Do what?”         “I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>, it sounded like <PER>Snape</PER> was feelin’ a  bit overworked, tha’s all — anyway, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told  him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there  was to it.
Well, there’s nothin’ strange  abou’ that!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> added hastily, as <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks full of meaning.
“All the  Heads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that  necklace business — ”   “Yeah, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s not having rows with the  rest of them, is he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I know what yeh’re like abou’ <PER>Snape</PER>,  <PER>Harry</PER>, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter  this than there is.”   “Look out,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tersely.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not need telling twice; he and <PER>Hermione</PER>  both hurried off; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s and Filch’s raised voices  echoed behind them as they ran.
It did not seem that people knew  about <PER>Ron</PER> yet; <PER>Harry</PER> was very relieved: He had been  interrogated enough that day.
So <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had argued with <PER>Snape</PER>.
In spite of all  he had told <PER>Harry</PER>, in spite of his insistence that he  trusted <PER>Snape</PER> completely, he had lost his temper with  him.
He did not think that <PER>Snape</PER> had tried hard  enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to  investigate a single Slytherin: <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
Was it because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to do  anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands,  that he had pretended there was nothing in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  suspicions?
It might even be that       <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want anything to distract <PER>Harry</PER>  from their lessons, or from procuring that memory  from Slughorn.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, had never been less interested in  Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
McLaggen kept up a constant stream of  hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper  for the team than <PER>Ron</PER>, and that now that <PER>Harry</PER> was  seeing him play regularly he would surely come  around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen  to criticize the other players and provide <PER>Harry</PER> with  detailed training schemes, so that more than once  <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to remind him who was Captain.
Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to <PER>Harry</PER> to  discuss <PER>Ron</PER>, which <PER>Harry</PER> found almost more wearing  than McLaggen’s Quidditch lectures.
At first,   Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had  thought to tell her that <PER>Ron</PER> was in the hospital wing  — “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but unfortunately  she had now decided to forgive <PER>Harry</PER> this lapse of  memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats  with him about <PER>Ron</PER>’s feelings, a most uncomfortable  experience that <PER>Harry</PER> would have happily forgone.
“Look, why don’t you talk to <PER>Ron</PER> about all this?”   <PER>Harry</PER> asked, after a particularly long interrogation  from Lavender that took in everything from precisely  what <PER>Ron</PER> had said about her new dress robes to  whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Ron</PER> considered his  relationship with Lavender to be “serious.”   “Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and  see him!” said Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised, for he had found <PER>Ron</PER>  perfectly alert every time he had been up to the  hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>’s row and keen to abuse  McLaggen as much as possible.
“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with  <PER>Ginny</PER>.”   “Oh,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking rather glum.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped short at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, then gave  a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> and  she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the  corner and vanishing from view.
This was infuriating; he was already  cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet  there was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, skulking off while the rest of the  school was absent: <PER>Harry</PER>’s best chance yet of  discovering what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to.
The silent seconds  trickled past, and <PER>Harry</PER> remained where he was,  frozen, gazing at the place where <PER>Malfoy</PER> had  vanished.
...   “Where have you been?” demanded <PER>Ginny</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER>  sprinted into the changing rooms.
“I met <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> told her quietly, as he pulled his  scarlet robes over his head.
...”   There was a note of badly suppressed glee in <PER>Ron</PER>’s  voice; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell he was nothing short of thrilled  that McLaggen had messed up so badly.
... Loser’s  Lurgy ...”   But <PER>Harry</PER> was still too angry to see much humor in  the situation, and after a while <PER>Ron</PER>’s snorts subsided.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> came in to visit while you were unconscious,”  he said, after a long pause, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination  zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in  which <PER>Ginny</PER>, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed  her feelings of deep attraction to him while <PER>Ron</PER> gave  them his blessing.
“Yeah ... well, I saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneaking off  with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted  to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made  sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the  rest of the school; he skipped the last match too,  remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> sighed.
“You couldn’t  have missed a Quidditch match just to follow <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  you’re the Captain!”   “I want to know what he’s up to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And  don’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I  overheard between him and <PER>Snape</PER> — ”   “I never said it was all in your head,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning  at <PER>Harry</PER>, “but there’s no rule saying only one person  at a time can be plotting anything in this place!
You’re  getting a bit obsessed with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would  have been able to set a tail upon <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but  unfortunately <PER>Harry</PER> did not have an office full of  Aurors at his command.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both  leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves  apart, though they continued to try and kick and  punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped         around the lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his  nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlockl”  Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped  from the room making obscene gestures but unable to  speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just  glued itself to the roof of his mouth.
“Okay then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he and <PER>Ron</PER> both  released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not  continue fighting.
“Dobby  would be honored to help <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”   “Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of  you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
I want you to tail  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and  exasperation on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “I want to  know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what  he’s doing.
“And if Dobby does it wrong,  Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter!”   “There won’t be any need for that,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily.
After a moment or two, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s  great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and  said, with bitter resentment, “Master thinks of  everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though  Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the  <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy, oh yes.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are okay.
Just stick to  <PER>Malfoy</PER> like a couple of wart plasters.”           LORD VOLDEMORT’S REQUEST   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> left the hospital wing first thing on  Monday morning, restored to full health by the  ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to  enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and  poisoned, the best of which was that <PER>Hermione</PER> was  friends with <PER>Ron</PER> again.
<PER>Hermione</PER> even escorted them  down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that  <PER>Ginny</PER> had argued with Dean.
“What did <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean row about, <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that  Bludger at you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It  looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught  <PER>Harry</PER> he could have been very badly hurt!”   “Yeah, well, there was no need for <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean to  split up over it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still trying to sound  casual.
“Or are they still together?”   “Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?”  asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> a sharp look.
“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up  again!” he said hastily, but <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to  look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a  voice behind them called, “<PER>Harry</PER>!” giving him an  excuse to turn his back on her.
...”   She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large  spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what       looked like cat litter into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hands, finally pulling  out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she  handed to <PER>Harry</PER>.
"... I’ve been told to give you this.”   It was a small roll of parchment, which <PER>Harry</PER>  recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson  with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Tonight,” he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, once he had  unrolled it.
“C’mon,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Hermione</PER>, and they sped  past, though not before they had heard Lavender say,  “Why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today?
And why was she with you?”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked both sulky and annoyed when he  appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though  he sat with Lavender, <PER>Harry</PER> did not see them  exchange a word all the time they were together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was acting as though she was quite  oblivious to all of this, but once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> saw an  inexplicable smirk cross her face.
All that day she  seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that  evening in the common room she even consented to  look over (in other words, finish writing) <PER>Harry</PER>’s  Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely  refusing to do up to this point, because she had  known that <PER>Harry</PER> would then let <PER>Ron</PER> copy his work.
“Thanks a lot, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, giving her a  hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and  saw that it was nearly eight o’clock.
“Enter,” called <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but as <PER>Harry</PER> put out a  hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from  inside.
“So this is the reason I am to be thrown  unceremoniously from your office, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “My dear Sybill,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a slightly  exasperated voice, “there is no question of throwing  you unceremoniously from anywhere, but <PER>Harry</PER> does  have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is  any more to be said — ”   “Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply  wounded voice.
...”   She pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> and disappeared down the  spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway  down, and <PER>Harry</PER> guessed that she had tripped over  one of her trailing shawls.
“Please close the door and sit down, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding rather tired.
<PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in  front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s desk that the Pensieve lay  between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal  bottles full of swirling memory.
She does not know —  and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her —  that she made the prophecy about you and  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, you see.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But  never mind my staffing problems.
What with  Apparition lessons and Quidditch and <PER>Ron</PER> being  poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his  determination to find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up  to, <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten about the memory  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had asked him to extract from Professor  Slughorn.
“I see,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> eventually, peering at <PER>Harry</PER>  over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving  <PER>Harry</PER> the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry,  but <PER>Harry</PER> would have preferred him to yell; this cold  disappointment was worse than anything.
“I see.”   Silence fell between them again, the most  uncomfortable silence <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced  with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; it seemed to go on and on,  punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the  portrait of Armando Dippet over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s head.
I should have realized you wouldn’t have  asked me to do it if it wasn’t really important.”   “Thank you for saying that, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  quietly.
“Now, you will  remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of  these meetings of ours that we would be entering the  realms of guesswork and speculation?”   “Yes, sir.”   “Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you  reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as  to what <PER>Voldemort</PER> did until the age of seventeen?”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
“But now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “now things  become murkier and stranger.
“I shall then be glad of your opinion as to  whether the conclusions I have drawn from them  seem likely.”   The idea that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> valued his opinion this  highly made <PER>Harry</PER> feel even more deeply ashamed  that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux  memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised the first of the two bottles to the  light and examined it.
The next thing the staff knew, <PER>Voldemort</PER> was  working at Borgin and Burkes.”       “At Borgin and Burkes?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, stunned.
What subject did he  want to teach?”   Somehow, <PER>Harry</PER> knew the answer even before  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave it.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was sent to persuade people to  part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and  he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing  this.”   “I’ll bet he was,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, unable to contain  himself.
“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf,  who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the  name of Hepzibah Smith.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork  flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the  Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> got to his feet and bent once more over the  rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his  face touched them.
The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a  tall young man <PER>Harry</PER> had no difficulty whatsoever in  recognizing as <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
...”   She hooked the cup back off <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s long  forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent  upon settling it carefully back into position to notice  the shadow that crossed <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face as the cup  was taken away.
Burke bought it, apparently, from a  ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it,  but had no idea of its true value — ”   There was no mistaking it this time: <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s eyes  flashed scarlet at the words, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw his  knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain.
For a  moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> was not going to  let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers  and was back in its red velvet cushion.
“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose — ”  said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and <PER>Harry</PER> guessed  that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s eyes.
The usual enchantments ...”         “Time to leave, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, and  as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> grasped <PER>Harry</PER> once again above the  elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and  back to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s office.
“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, resuming his seat and indicating  that <PER>Harry</PER> should do the same.
“It was  concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being  old and confused — ”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER> modified her memory, just like he did with  Morfin!”   “Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Now,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “if you don’t mind, <PER>Harry</PER>, I  want to pause once more to draw your attention to  certain points of our story.
... Risking  everything, throwing away his job, just for those ...”       “Mad to you, perhaps, but not to <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I hope you will understand in due  course exactly what those objects meant to him,  <PER>Harry</PER>, but you must admit that it is not difficult to  imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully  his.”   “The locket maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but why take the  cup as well?”   “It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,”  said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to his feet once more as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.
And <PER>Harry</PER> dived after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through the  shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had  just left.
There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his  perch, and there behind the desk was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  who looked very similar to the <PER>Dumbledore</PER> standing  beside <PER>Harry</PER>, though both hands were whole and  undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less  lined.
The younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be waiting for  something, and sure enough, moments after their  arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said,  “Enter.”   <PER>Harry</PER> let out a hastily stifled gasp.
“Won’t  you sit down?”   “Thank you,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and he took the seat to  which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gestured — the very seat, by  the looks of it, that <PER>Harry</PER> had just vacated in the  present.
Nevertheless,  <PER>Harry</PER> felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly:  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s refusal to use <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chosen  name was a refusal to allow <PER>Voldemort</PER> to dictate the  terms of the meeting, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> took it as such.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not break the  silence that stretched between them now, but waited,  with a look of pleasant expectancy, for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to  talk first.
I could show and  tell your students things they can gain from no other  wizard.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered <PER>Voldemort</PER> over the top of his  own goblet for a while before speaking.
You must know this, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do  you?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> delicately.
“But nothing I  have seen in the world has supported your famous  pronouncements that love is more powerful than my  kind of magic, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,”  suggested <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
What will  happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor  has it — the Death Eaters?”         <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not expected  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to know this name; he saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.
Devoted  friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy  night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to  secure a teaching post.”   There could be no doubt that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s detailed  knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was  even less welcome to <PER>Voldemort</PER>; however, he rallied  almost at once.
“You are omniscient as ever, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   “Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lightly.
...”   For a second, <PER>Harry</PER> was on the verge of shouting a  pointless warning: He was sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s hand  had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but  then the moment had passed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had turned  away, the door was closing, and he was gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s hand close over his arm  again and moments later, they were standing together       on almost the same spot, but there was no snow  building on the window ledge, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
“Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, looking up into  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
Did you  ever find out?”   “I have ideas,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “but no more than  that.”   “What ideas, sir?”   “I shall tell you, <PER>Harry</PER>, when you have retrieved that  memory from Professor Slughorn,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“When you have that last piece of the jigsaw,  everything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us.”   <PER>Harry</PER> was still burning with curiosity and even  though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had walked to the door and was  holding it open for him, he did not move at once.
You see, we have never  been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post  to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”           THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM   <PER>Harry</PER> wracked his brains over the next week as to  how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the  true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain  wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he  did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring  over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would  have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he  had done so many times before.
“Don’t start, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If it hadn’t been  for the Prince, <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t be sitting here now.”   “He would if you’d just listened to <PER>Snape</PER> in our first  year,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> dismissively.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who had now achieved  Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but  <PER>Harry</PER>, who would not be seventeen for another four  months, could not take the test whether ready or not.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about  Apparition, <PER>Ron</PER> was now struggling to finish a  viciously difficult essay for <PER>Snape</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had already completed.
<PER>Harry</PER> fully  expected to receive low marks on his, because he had  disagreed with <PER>Snape</PER> on the best way to tackle  dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory  was the most important thing to him now.
‘Tm telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be  able to help you with this, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  more loudly.
“It  can’t be B — U — M — ”   “No, it isn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling <PER>Ron</PER>’s essay  toward her.
...”   “Yes, it must,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pointing at the title of  his essay, “because we were asked how we’d deal with  dementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and I don’t remember you  changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.”   “Ah no!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, staring horror-struck at the  parchment.
“I love you, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sinking back in his  chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t  let Lavender hear you saying that.”   “I won’t,” said <PER>Ron</PER> into his hands.
“You and Cho just — ”   “Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>   “Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,”  said <PER>Ron</PER> gloomily, watching <PER>Hermione</PER> silently  tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of  her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the  page.
It’s like going out with the giant  squid.”   “There,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, some twenty minutes later,  handing back <PER>Ron</PER>’s essay.
“Can I borrow your quill  for the conclusion?”   <PER>Harry</PER>, who had found nothing useful in the Half-  Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three  of them were now the only ones left in the common  room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing  <PER>Snape</PER> and his essay.
The only sounds were the      crackling of the fire and <PER>Ron</PER> scratching out one last  paragraph on dementors using <PER>Hermione</PER>’s quill.
<PER>Hermione</PER> let out a little shriek; <PER>Ron</PER> spilled ink all  over his freshly completed essay, and <PER>Harry</PER> said,  “Kreacher!”   The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own  gnarled toes.
“And  Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to  see <PER>Harry</PER> Potter so they can make their reports  together!”   “What is this?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, still looking shocked  by these sudden appearances.
“What’s going on,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated before answering, because he had not  told <PER>Hermione</PER> about setting Kreacher and Dobby to  tail <PER>Malfoy</PER>; house-elves were always such a touchy  subject with her.
But surely, <PER>Harry</PER>, you  didn’t tell him not to — ”   “No, of course I didn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“His features  recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners  are those of — ”   “<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy  and said defiantly to Kreacher, “But Kreacher should  know that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is not a good master to a  house-elf!”         “Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love  with <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Kreacher.
“Let’s fast forward  to where he’s actually been going.”   Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said,  “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a  dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in  a variety of — ”   “Dobby, you tell me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, cutting across  Kreacher.
“Has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t  have?”   “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike  eyes shining in the firelight, “the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy is  breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is  still keen to avoid detection.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at him.
“If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.”   “Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at  what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s doing?” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> got into our  headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in  and spy on him, no problem.”   “But I don’t think you will, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  slowly.
But you don’t  know what the room becomes when <PER>Malfoy</PER> goes in  there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform  into.”   “There’ll be a way around that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  dismissively.
“You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.”   “Kreacher’s done well too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> kindly; but  far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge,  bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The  Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will  pretend he cannot hear — ”   “Get out of it,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped at him, and Kreacher  made one last deep bow and Disapparated.
“How good’s this?” said <PER>Harry</PER> enthusiastically,  turning to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the moment the room  was elf-free again.
Crabbe and Goyle!”   “Do you mean to say,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a hushed  voice, “that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ?”         “Yeah, of course!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, staring at her.
“Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically, rolling up <PER>Ron</PER>’s dried essay  before it could come to any more harm and handing it  to him.
He lay awake for  what felt like hours, wondering how <PER>Malfoy</PER> was using  the Room of Requirement and what he, <PER>Harry</PER>, would  see when he went in there the following day, for  whatever <PER>Hermione</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that if  <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been able to see the headquarters of the  D.A., he would be able to see <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s ... what could it  be?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s mind worked feverishly and his  dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and  disturbed by images of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who turned into  Slughorn, who turned into <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was rather ostentatiously  showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing  entry into the room, which irritated <PER>Harry</PER>, because he  thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.
“I haven’t forgotten about  Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that  memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why  shouldn’t I find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s doing?”   “I’ve already told you, you need to persuade  Slughorn,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Instead of messing around  outside the Room of Requirement” — she jerked the      Prophet out from under <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and unfolded it  to look at the front page — “you should go and find  Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.”   “Anyone we know — ?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER>  scanned the headlines.
“Yes!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, causing both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to  gag on their breakfast.
<PER>Hermione</PER> set  off immediately for Ancient Runes; <PER>Ron</PER> for the  common room, where he still had to finish his  conclusion on <PER>Snape</PER>’s dementor essay; and <PER>Harry</PER> for  the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of  wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy  teaching trolls to do ballet.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether his chances  of getting inside the room were better with <PER>Malfoy</PER>  inside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not  going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or  Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.
I need you to become the place you become for <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried every variation of “I need to see what  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is doing inside you” that he could think  of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced  to concede that <PER>Hermione</PER> might have had a point:   The room simply did not want to open for him.
“Late again, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, as <PER>Harry</PER>  hurried into the candlelit classroom.
“Ten points from  Gryffindor.”   <PER>Harry</PER> scowled at <PER>Snape</PER> as he flung himself into the  seat beside <PER>Ron</PER>; half the class was still on its feet,  taking out books and organizing their things; he  could not be much later than any of them.
“But sir, I heard people talking — ”   “If you had actually read the article in question, Mr.  Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called  Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the  name of Mundungus Fletcher.”   “I thought <PER>Snape</PER> and Mundungus were on the same  side,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest     “But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,”  said <PER>Snape</PER>, pointing suddenly at the back of the  room, his black eyes fixed on <PER>Harry</PER> “Let us ask Potter  how we would tell the difference between an Inferius  and a ghost.”   The whole class looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, who hastily  tried to recall what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told him the  night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by  now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the  earth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us,  transparent.”   “Well, what <PER>Harry</PER> said is the most useful if we’re  trying to tell them apart!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I  would expect nothing more sophisticated from you,  <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate  half an inch across a room.”   “IVo!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm as  he opened his mouth furiously.
When  the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender  caught up with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> (<PER>Hermione</PER>  mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached)       and abused <PER>Snape</PER> hotly for his jibe about <PER>Ron</PER>’s  Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate <PER>Ron</PER>,  and he shook her off by making a detour into the  boys’ bathroom with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s right, though, isn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, after  staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two.
“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back  over his shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in  Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.”   And so the following weekend, <PER>Ron</PER> joined <PER>Hermione</PER>  and the rest of the sixth years who would turn  seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight.
“You’d do better,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when he confided  this plan to <PER>Ron</PER> and her in the entrance hall, “to go  straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that  memory from him.”   “I’ve been trying!” said <PER>Harry</PER> crossly, which was  perfectly true.
He wished <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both luck,  then turned and climbed the marble staircase again,  determined, whatever <PER>Hermione</PER> said, to devote an  hour or two to the Room of Requirement.
Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to contemplate the blank wall  behind which, he was sure, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was now  standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was      out there, but not daring to make an appearance.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt frustrated beyond  belief; <PER>Malfoy</PER> might be just feet away from him, and  there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to  what he was doing in there.
“Well ... I’ll see you around, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   And she turned abruptly and walked back down the  corridor, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stare after her.
Finally, a      hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would soon be back for lunch  made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor  to <PER>Malfoy</PER> who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave  for some hours to come.
He found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the Great Hall,  already halfway through an early lunch.
“I did it — well, kind of!” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>  enthusiastically when he caught sight of him.
“How’d you do, <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, before  <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer.
“Perfect deliberation,  divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is  — we all went for a quick drink in the Three  Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross  going on about her — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t  pop the question soon — ”   “And what about you?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring  <PER>Ron</PER>.
Tonks!”   “Tonks?” repeated <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together,  looking surprised.
...”   “If you ask me,” said <PER>Ron</PER> once <PER>Harry</PER> had finished  describing his conversation with Tonks, “she’s       cracking up a bit.
“She’s supposed to be  guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning  her post to come and see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when he’s not  even here?”   “I had a thought,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tentatively.
Women,” he  said wisely to <PER>Harry</PER>, “they’re easily upset.”   “And yet,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, coming out of her reverie, “I  doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an  hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their  joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus  mimbletonia.”   <PER>Ron</PER> scowled.
“For the last time, just forget about <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  told <PER>Harry</PER> firmly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were both  clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common  Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for  they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but  by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to  the nerves.
<PER>Ron</PER> gave a start and tried to hide behind <PER>Hermione</PER> as  a girl came around the corner.
Once the girl was out of earshot he said,  “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said we wouldn’t be having any more  lessons until I got the memory!”   “Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?”  suggested <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> unrolled the  parchment; but rather than finding <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy  sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of  large blotches on the parchment where the ink had  run.
Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>,   Aragog died last night <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, you met him,  and you know how special he was.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>       “Look at this,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing the note to  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
And now <PER>Hagrid</PER> expects us to go down  there and cry over its horrible hairy body!”   “It’s not just that,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you can’t be thinking of going,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I s’pose  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’ll have to bury Aragog without us.”         “Yes, he will,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, that’s it — get  lucky!”   “What d’you mean?”   “Use your lucky potion!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, that’s — that’s it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding  stunned.
“What on earth is more important than this memory,  <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The thought of that little golden  bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for  some time; vague and unformulated plans that  involved <PER>Ginny</PER> splitting up with Dean, and <PER>Ron</PER>  somehow being happy to see her with a new  boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his  brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the  twilight time between sleeping and waking.
“Oh, stop that,” <PER>Ron</PER> begged her, “I feel sick enough as  it is — quick, hide me!”   “It isn’t Lavender!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, as  another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and  <PER>Ron</PER> dived behind her.
“Cool,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, peering over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder to  check.
...”   The bell rang overhead in the castle and both  <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jumped to their feet, looking  terrified.
“Good luck.”   “And you too!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a significant look,  as <PER>Harry</PER> headed off to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that  afternoon: <PER>Harry</PER>, Ernie, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Undoubtedly, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, watching him over  the top of his own book, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was begrudging the  time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of  Requirement.
Cheered by this thought, <PER>Harry</PER> skimmed through his  copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily  corrected Half-Blood Prince’s version of “An Elixir to  Induce Euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet  Slughorn ’s instructions, but which might (<PER>Harry</PER>’s  heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn  into such a good mood that he would be prepared to  hand over that memory if <PER>Harry</PER> could persuade him  to taste some.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn  had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely  “passable.”   The bell rang and both Ernie and <PER>Malfoy</PER> left at once.
“Sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Slughorn immediately glanced  over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was  empty but for himself and <PER>Harry</PER>, he hurried away as  fast as he could.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned in the late afternoon.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER> as she climbed through the  portrait hole.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>?”   “He — he just failed,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER>  came slouching into the room looking most morose.
... How  did it go with Slughorn?”   “No joy,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> joined them.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER> — you going to use the Felix Felicis or  what?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded.
Right ... I’m  going down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.”         “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, looking  aghast.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER> — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn,  remember?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s,   I’ve got a good feeling about going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.”   “You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant  spider?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, looking stunned.
“I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you  know what I mean?”   “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, both looking  positively alarmed now.
“You  haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know     “Essence of Insanity?” suggested <PER>Ron</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER>  swung his cloak over his shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked even  more alarmed.
“I know what I’m doing ... or at  least” — he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix  does.”   He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set  off down the stairs, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurrying along  behind him.
“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked  Lavender Brown, staring right through <PER>Harry</PER> at <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerging together from the boys’  dormitories.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> spluttering behind him  as he darted across the room away from them.
Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he  approached it, <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean came through it, and  <PER>Harry</PER> was able to slip between them.
But why  are you out here, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “Well, sir, it’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew that the  right thing to do just now was to tell the truth.
“But I know that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Hagrid</PER> to the hilt, so I’m sure he  can’t be up to anything very dreadful.
...”   He bustled back into the castle, and <PER>Harry</PER> sped off to  <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s, delighted with himself.
“Yeh came,” croaked <PER>Hagrid</PER>, when he opened the door  and saw <PER>Harry</PER> emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in  front of him.
“Yeah — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t, though,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was  the highest point of <PER>Hagrid</PER> he could easily reach.
Can yeh believe that, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   The honest answer was “yes”; <PER>Harry</PER> recalled with  painful ease the scene when he and <PER>Ron</PER> had come  face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been  quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that  stopped them from eating <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
But I wanted ter give  ’im a nice burial ... a proper send-off ...”   He broke into sobs again and <PER>Harry</PER> resumed the  patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the  potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing  to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming down  here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   “Not in trouble, are yeh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking up,  alarmed.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought privately that what Aragog would have  liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of  edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the  rear window of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s hut, where he saw the rather  horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its  back outside, its legs curled and tangled.
“Are we going to bury him here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, in your  garden?”   “Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER> in a choked voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw  the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak,  though <PER>Hagrid</PER>, mopping his eyes once more, noticed  nothing.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,”  said Slughorn, who like <PER>Harry</PER> could reach no higher  than <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s elbow, but patted it all the same.
... Up you  come, <PER>Hagrid</PER> ... Well done ...”   They deposited <PER>Hagrid</PER> in a chair at the table.
“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured <PER>Harry</PER>,  pouring most of the first bottle into one of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s  bucket- sized mugs and handing it to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Had a  house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to  your poor friend Rupert.”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s face if she ever heard about this abuse of  house-elves, and decided never to mention it to her.
Well” —  he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.”   “Aragog,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> together.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school  until ... well ...”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face darkened and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why: Tom  Riddle had contrived to have <PER>Hagrid</PER> thrown out of  school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets.
“That’s never unicorn hair, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   “Oh, yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> indifferently.
He refilled <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mug and his  own, and questioned him about the creatures that  lived in the forest these days and how <PER>Hagrid</PER> was  able to look after them all.
<PER>Harry</PER>  had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm  without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea  that he might not be able to do it tonight was  laughable: Indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> grinned to himself as,  unnoticed by either <PER>Hagrid</PER> or Slughorn (now  swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he  pointed his wand under the table at the emptying  bottles and they immediately began to refill.
After an hour or so, <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Slughorn began  making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to elf-made wine, and to —   “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, slopping some of his  fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he  drained it.
“Me dad  was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum an’ dad,  <PER>Harry</PER>...”   Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s  crinkled eyes again; he grasped <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and  shook it.
“Can’t carry a  tune to save my life.”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER> wasn’t talking about your singing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>  quietly.
“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s heavy snores.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> murdered him and then stepped  over his body toward my mum,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But then ... my dear boy ... you’re asking a great deal  ... you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your  attempt to destroy — ”         “You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily  Evans?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, of course I do, but — ”   “You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?”   Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.
Yeah, I would go and take  it up with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if he was here, because he’s  the one who wanted me to — ”   “He is here,” said a voice behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> returned to the school an hour ago.”   Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward <PER>Harry</PER>, his  head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.
“I believe, from what  the Baron said, that he had business to attend to  before turning in — ”   “Yeah, he has,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, excitement blazing in his  chest at the prospect of telling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> he had  secured the memory.
The password’s still ‘tapeworm’!”         But <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurtling back along the  corridor and within minutes, he was saying “toffee  eclairs” to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s gargoyle, which leapt aside,  permitting <PER>Harry</PER> entrance onto the spiral staircase.
“Enter,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> knocked.
“Good gracious, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in surprise.
I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.”   <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, quickly ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his  feet leave the office floor.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed beside <PER>Harry</PER> just as Riddle  asked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is  retiring?”   “Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said  Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle,  though winking at the same time.
...   “Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
...” '   When <PER>Harry</PER> landed back on the office floor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was already sitting down behind his  desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat too and waited for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to  speak.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “I am sure you  understood the significance of what we just heard.
As far as I know — as far,  I am sure, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew — no wizard had ever  done more than tear his soul in two.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused for a moment, marshaling his  thoughts, and then said, “Four years ago, I received  what I considered certain proof that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  split his soul.”   “Where?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> “How?”   “You handed it to me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Yet it fitted: Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has  seemed to grow less human with the passing years,  and the transformation he has undergone seemed to  me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated  beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’     “So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering  other people?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But now, <PER>Harry</PER>, armed with this information, the  crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for  us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER> than anyone has ever been before.
Yes, I  think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly  appeal to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   “He made seven Horcruxes?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, horror-  struck, while several of the portraits on the walls  made similar noises of shock and outrage.
That seventh  piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to  kill <PER>Voldemort</PER> must attack — the piece that lives in  his body.”   “But the six Horcruxes, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, a little  desperately, “how are we supposed to find them?”   “You are forgetting .
His pride, his belief in his own superiority,  his determination to carve for himself a startling place  in magical history; these things suggest to me that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have chosen his Horcruxes with  some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.”   “The diary wasn’t that special.”   “The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that  he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> considered it of stupendous importance.”   “So, the other Horcruxes?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
I have therefore trawled back  through <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s past to see if I can find evidence  that such artifacts have disappeared around him.”   “The locket!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
She underlines the  Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of  her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to  keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual  amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.”   “So,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone.
There are hopeful signs.”   “And if you do,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, “can I come with  you and help get rid of it?”       <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> very intently for a  moment before saying, “Yes, I think so.”   “I can?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thoroughly taken aback.
The  headmasters and headmistresses around the walls  seemed less impressed by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s decision;  <PER>Harry</PER> saw a few of them shaking their heads and  Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.
When <PER>Voldemort</PER> discovered that the diary  had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am  told that his anger was terrible to behold.”   “But I thought he meant Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> to smuggle it  into Hogwarts?”   “Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would  be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was  supposed to wait for <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s say-so, and he never  received it, for <PER>Voldemort</PER> vanished shortly after giving  him the diary.
Ah, poor Lucius ... what with  <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s fury about the fact that he threw away  the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the  Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is  not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the  moment.”   <PER>Harry</PER> sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if  all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> could be  killed?”   “Yes, I think so,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
It will  take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like  <PER>Voldemort</PER> even without his Horcruxes.”   “But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, before he could stop himself.
“I can love!” It was  only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding,  “Big deal!”   “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>, you can love,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who  looked as though he knew perfectly well what <PER>Harry</PER>  had just refrained from saying.
You are still too young to  understand how unusual you are, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the  Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked  <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling a little let down.
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, never  forget that what the prophecy says is only significant  because <PER>Voldemort</PER> made it so.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> singled you out as the  person who would be most dangerous to him — and  in doing so, he made you the person who would be  most dangerous to him!”   “But it comes to the same — ”   “No, it doesn’t!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding impatient  now.
Pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> with his black, withered hand,  he said, “You are setting too much store by the  prophecy!”   “But,” spluttered <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you said the prophecy  means — ”   “If <PER>Voldemort</PER> had never heard of the prophecy, would  it have been fulfilled?
Do you think every prophecy in the  Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”         “But,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, bewildered, “but last year, you said  one of us would have to kill the other — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, only because <PER>Voldemort</PER> made a grave  error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words!
He heard the prophecy and he leapt  into action, with the result that he not only  handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he  handed him uniquely deadly weapons!”   “But — ”   “It is essential that you understand this!” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, standing up and striding about the  room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake;  <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen him so agitated.
It is <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s fault  that you were able to see into his thoughts, his  ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike  language in which he gives orders, and yet, <PER>Harry</PER>,  despite your privileged insight into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s world  (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would  kill to have), you have never been seduced by the  Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the         slightest desire to become one of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  followers!”   “Of course I haven’t!” said <PER>Harry</PER> indignantly.
I do not think he  understands why, <PER>Harry</PER>, but then, he was in such a  hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to  understand the incomparable power of a soul that is  untarnished and whole.”   “But, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making valiant efforts not to  sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing,  doesn’t it?
Think!”         <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER> striding up and down in  front of him, and thought.
Some people, perhaps, would say that  there was little to choose between the two ways, but  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew — and so do I, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, with  a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that  there was all the difference in the world.
SECTUMSEMPRA   Exhausted but delighted with his night’s work, <PER>Harry</PER>  told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything that had happened  during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first  cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them).
They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he  had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and  positively awed when he told them about <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  Horcruxes and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s promise to take <PER>Harry</PER>  along, should he find another one.
“Wow,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had finally finished  telling them everything; <PER>Ron</PER> was waving his wand  very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without  paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was  doing.
You’re actually going to go with  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ... and try and destroy ... wow.”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, you’re making it snow,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand  away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large  white flakes had started to fall.
Lavender Brown,        <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, glared at <PER>Hermione</PER> from a neighboring  table through very red eyes, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  immediately let go of <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm.
<PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean split up too, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought there was a rather knowing look in her  eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly  know that his insides were suddenly dancing the  conga.
“If <PER>Ginny</PER> and  Dean aren’t speaking ...”   “Oh — oh yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The tiny little  Charms master was bobbing his way toward them,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> was the only one who had managed to  turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep  crimson liquid, whereas the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>’s and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s were still murky brown.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s vinegar turned to ice; <PER>Ron</PER>’s flask exploded.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be positively lighthearted  about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed cheery too, though when asked  what she was grinning about she simply said, “It’s a         nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed  that a fierce battle was raging inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain:   She’s <PER>Ron</PER>’s sister.
He’s your best mate\   <PER>Harry</PER> barely noticed that they were climbing through  the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and  only vaguely registered the small group of seventh  years clustered together there, until <PER>Hermione</PER> cried,  “Katie!
...”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “well, now you’re back and <PER>Ron</PER>’s  fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing       Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the  running for the Cup.
...”   She caught up her bag and books and hurried after  her friends, leaving <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to sit  down at a window table and ponder what she had told  them.
“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave  Katie the necklace,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to be in the  ladies’ bathroom.”   “Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, “and have a go at the Room of Requirement  again.”   “That would be a complete waste of potion,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman’s  Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>,  ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He took the blow stoically enough  when <PER>Harry</PER> told him, merely grunting and shrugging,  but <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct feeling as he walked away  that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously  behind his back.
Her imitations of <PER>Ron</PER> anxiously bobbing  up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle  sped toward him, or of <PER>Harry</PER> bellowing orders at  McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them  all highly amused.
<PER>Harry</PER>, laughing with the others,  was glad to have an innocent reason to look at <PER>Ginny</PER>;  he had received several more Bludger injuries during  practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on  the Snitch.
The battle still raged inside his head: <PER>Ginny</PER> or <PER>Ron</PER>?
Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER>  might not mind too much if he asked <PER>Ginny</PER> out, but  then he remembered <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression when he had  seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that <PER>Ron</PER> would         consider it base treachery if <PER>Harry</PER> so much as held  her hand.
Yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not help himself talking to <PER>Ginny</PER>,  laughing with her, walking back from practice with  her; however much his conscience ached, he found  himself wondering how best to get her on her own.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> considered asking for  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s help, but he did not think he could stand  seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he  caught it sometimes when <PER>Hermione</PER> spotted him  staring at <PER>Ginny</PER> or laughing at her jokes.
And to  complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if  he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask <PER>Ginny</PER>  out soon: He and <PER>Ron</PER> were at least agreed on the fact  that she was too popular for her own good.
The balmy days slid gently through  May, and <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be there at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder  every time he saw <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> found himself longing  for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause <PER>Ron</PER> to  realize that nothing would make him happier than his  best friend and his sister falling for each other and to  leave them alone together for longer than a few  seconds.
There seemed no chance of either while the  final Quidditch game of the season was looming; <PER>Ron</PER>  wanted to talk tactics with <PER>Harry</PER> all the time and had  little thought for anything else.
Somehow, the game had become  inextricably linked in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind with success or  failure in his plans for <PER>Ginny</PER>.
In the midst of all his preoccupations, <PER>Harry</PER> had not  forgotten his other ambition: finding out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>  was up to in the Room of Requirement.
He was still  checking the Marauder’s Map, and as he was unable  to locate <PER>Malfoy</PER> on it, deduced that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still  spending plenty of time within the room.
A few days before the match against Ravenclaw,   <PER>Harry</PER> found himself walking down to dinner alone  from the common room, <PER>Ron</PER> having rushed off into a  nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> having dashed off to see Professor Vector  about a mistake she thought she might have made in  her last Arithmancy essay.
For a moment he could not find <PER>Malfoy</PER>  anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the  Room of Requirement again, but then he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the  floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle,  but by Moaning Myrtle.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing with his back to the door,  his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-  blond head bowed.
...”   And <PER>Harry</PER> realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to  root him to the spot, that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was crying —       actually crying — tears streaming down his pale face  into the grimy basin.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> gasped and gulped and  then, with a great shudder, looked up into the  cracked mirror and saw <PER>Harry</PER> staring at him over his  shoulder.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hex  missed <PER>Harry</PER> by inches, shattering the lamp on the  wall beside him; <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself sideways,  thought Levicorpus\ and flicked his wand, but <PER>Malfoy</PER>  blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another —   “No!
STOP!”   There was a loud bang and the bin behind <PER>Harry</PER>  exploded; <PER>Harry</PER> attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that  backfired off the wall behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s ear and  smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who  screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and <PER>Harry</PER>  slipped as <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci — ”   “ SECTUMSEMPRAl” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER> from the floor,  waving his wand wildly.
Slipping and staggering, <PER>Harry</PER> got to his feet and  plunged toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, whose face was now shining  scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-  soaked chest.
“No — I didn’t — ”     <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what he was saying; he fell to his  knees beside <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was shaking uncontrollably  in a pool of his own blood.
MURDER!”   The door banged open behind <PER>Harry</PER> and he looked  up, terrified: <PER>Snape</PER> had burst into the room, his face  livid.
Pushing <PER>Harry</PER> roughly aside, he knelt over  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep  wounds <PER>Harry</PER>’s curse had made, muttering an  incantation that sounded almost like song.
The flow  of blood seemed to ease; <PER>Snape</PER> wiped the residue  from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face and repeated his spell.
When <PER>Snape</PER> had performed his  countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted <PER>Malfoy</PER>  into a standing position.
...”   He supported <PER>Malfoy</PER> across the bathroom, turning at  the door to say in a voice of cold fury, “And you,   Potter ... You wait here for me.”   It did not occur to <PER>Harry</PER> for a second to disobey.
He stared into         <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes, hoping against hope that <PER>Snape</PER>  had not seen what he feared, but —   “Bring me your schoolbag,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “and all  of your schoolbooks.
Would he tell  Slughorn — <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach churned — how <PER>Harry</PER>  had been achieving such good results in Potions all  year?
Is that  blood?”   <PER>Ron</PER> was standing at the top of the stairs, looking  bewildered at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Quick ... give it to me ...”   “But what about the Half-Blood — ”   “I’ll explain later!”         <PER>Ron</PER> pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of  his bag and handed it over; <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted off past  him and back to the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor  below, cramming <PER>Ron</PER>’s copy of Advanced Potion-  Making into his bag as he did so.
A minute later, he  was back in front of <PER>Snape</PER>, who held out his hand  wordlessly for <PER>Harry</PER>’s schoolbag.
One by one, <PER>Snape</PER> extracted <PER>Harry</PER>’s books and  examined them.
“Then why,” asked <PER>Snape</PER>, “does it have the name  ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart missed a beat.
What do you think, Potter?”   “I — I don’t agree, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still refusing to  look into <PER>Snape</PER> ’s eyes.
“Poor Gryffindor ... fourth  place this year, I fear ...”   And he left the bathroom without another word,  leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling  sicker, he was sure, than <PER>Ron</PER> had ever felt in his life.
“Leave it, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
He had just finished telling <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  <PER>Ginny</PER> what had happened, not that there seemed to  have been much need.
The news had traveled very  fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon  herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to  tell the story; <PER>Malfoy</PER> had already been visited in the  hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no  time in vilifying <PER>Harry</PER> far and wide, and <PER>Snape</PER> had  told the staff precisely what had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> had  already been called out of the common room to  endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the  company of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who had told him  he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she  supported wholeheartedly <PER>Snape</PER> ’s punishment of  detention every Saturday until the end of term.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how can you still stick up  for that book when that spell — ”   “Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped  <PER>Harry</PER>.
I’d never have known how to save <PER>Ron</PER>  from poisoning, I’d never have — ”   “ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t  deserve,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> nastily.
“Give it a rest, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was  so amazed, so grateful, he looked up.
“By the sound  of it, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse,  you should be glad <PER>Harry</PER> had something good up his  sleeve!”   “Well, of course I’m glad <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t cursed!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, clearly stung.
And I’d have thought, seeing what this  has done to your chances in the match — ”   “Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand  Quidditch,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>, “you’ll only embarrass  yourself.”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared: <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, who had  always got on together very well, were now sitting  with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked nervously at <PER>Harry</PER>, then snatched up a  book at random and hid behind it.
By  Saturday morning, whatever he might have told  <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would have gladly exchanged all the  Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the  Quidditch pitch with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and the others.
“Ah, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had knocked on  his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office  that <PER>Snape</PER>, despite teaching floors above now, had  not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same  slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions  all around the walls.
It was, as <PER>Harry</PER> had anticipated, useless, boring  work, punctuated (as <PER>Snape</PER> had clearly planned) with  the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just  read his father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled  together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally  accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter  Pettigrew.
<PER>Snape</PER>, who had not spoken  at all since setting <PER>Harry</PER> his task, finally looked up at  ten past one.
You will continue at ten o’clock  next Saturday.”   “Yes, sir.”   <PER>Harry</PER> stuffed a bent card into the box at random and  hurried out of the door before <PER>Snape</PER> could change his  mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his  ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet.
“We won!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, bounding into sight and  brandishing the silver Cup at <PER>Harry</PER>.
We won!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around; there was <PER>Ginny</PER> running  toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face  as she threw her arms around him.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over the  top of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a  shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane  looking as though she might throw something.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was beaming, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes sought <PER>Ron</PER>.
For a fraction of a second they  looked at each other, then <PER>Ron</PER> gave a tiny jerk of the  head that <PER>Harry</PER> understood to mean, Well — if you  must.
THE SEER OVERHEARD   The fact that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was going out with <PER>Ginny</PER>  Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people,  most of them girls, yet <PER>Harry</PER> found himself newly and  happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks.
“You’d think people had better things to gossip  about,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, as she sat on the common room  floor, leaning against <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs and reading the  Daily Prophet “Three dementor attacks in a week, and  all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got  a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both roared with laughter.
“And what did you tell  her <PER>Ron</PER>’s got?”   “A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.”   <PER>Ron</PER> scowled as <PER>Hermione</PER> rolled around laughing.
“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Anyway, you  said yourself you’d rather it was <PER>Harry</PER> than Michael  or Dean.”   “Yeah, I would,” said <PER>Ron</PER> grudgingly.
But <PER>Ron</PER>’s tolerance was not to be tested much as  they moved into June, for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s time  together was becoming increasingly restricted.
On  one such evening, when <PER>Ginny</PER> had retired to the  library, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting beside the window in  the common room, supposedly finishing his  Herbology homework but in reality reliving a  particularly happy hour he had spent down by the  lake with <PER>Ginny</PER> at lunchtime, <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped into      the seat between him and <PER>Ron</PER> with an unpleasantly  purposeful look on her face.
“I want to talk to you, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “What about?” said <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously.
Only the  previous day, <PER>Hermione</PER> had told him off for  distracting <PER>Ginny</PER> when she ought to be working hard  for her examinations.
“Will you please drop it?”   He had not dared to return to the Room of  Requirement to retrieve his book, and his  performance in Potions was suffering accordingly  (though Slughorn, who approved of <PER>Ginny</PER>, had  jocularly attributed this to <PER>Harry</PER> being lovesick).
But  <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that <PER>Snape</PER> had not yet given up hope  of laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was  determined to leave it where it was while <PER>Snape</PER>  remained on the lookout.
“Prince,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, PrinceV’   “Right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, red patches blazing in her  cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out         of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in  front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Look at the picture!”     <PER>Harry</PER> picked up the crumbling piece of paper and  stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age;  <PER>Ron</PER> leaned over for a look too.
Prince, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   They looked at each other, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized what  <PER>Hermione</PER> was trying to say.
I mean, I’m  not saying that spell you used on <PER>Malfoy</PER> was great — ”   “Nor am I,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Thanks to <PER>Snape</PER> ...”   “You still got detention with <PER>Snape</PER> this Saturday?”  <PER>Ron</PER> continued.
Indeed, he had  frequently wondered lately whether <PER>Snape</PER> did not  know this, for he was keeping <PER>Harry</PER> later and later  every time, while making pointed asides about <PER>Harry</PER>  having to miss the good weather and the varied  opportunities it offered.
“Thanks, Jimmy ... Hey, it’s from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said  <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly, unrolling the parchment and  scanning it.
He hurried out of the common room and along the  seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but  Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction,  throwing bits of chalk at <PER>Harry</PER> in a routine sort of  way and cackling loudly as he dodged <PER>Harry</PER>’s  defensive jinx.
“I think you’d better tell Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
If  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> chooses to ignore the warnings the cards  show — ” Her bony hand closed suddenly around  <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist.
Would <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have let me teach at this great  school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I  not proved myself to him?”   <PER>Harry</PER> mumbled something indistinct.
and I remember I was starting to  feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but  then ...”   And now <PER>Harry</PER> was paying attention properly for the  first time, for he knew what had happened then:  Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had  altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy  about him and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
"... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus  <PER>Snape</PER>!”   “What?”   “Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it  flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman  standing with <PER>Snape</PER>, who was waffling about having  come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid  that I myself rather thought he had been  apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — you see, he himself was seeking a job  at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips!
Well,  after that, you know, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed much more  disposed to give me a job, and I could not help      thinking, <PER>Harry</PER>, that it was because he appreciated  the stark contrast between my own unassuming  manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing,  thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at  keyholes — <PER>Harry</PER>, dear?”   She looked back over her shoulder, having only just  realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was no longer with her; he had  stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each  other.
It was  <PER>Snape</PER> who had carried the news of the prophecy to  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> and Peter Pettigrew together had  sent <PER>Voldemort</PER> hunting after Lily and James and  their son.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — I  thought we were going to see the headmaster  together?”   “You stay here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> through numb lips.
He did not knock upon  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s door, he hammered; and the calm voice  answered, “Enter” after <PER>Harry</PER> had already flung  himself into the room.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>, I promised that you could come with  me.”   For a moment or two, <PER>Harry</PER> did not understand; the  conversation with Trelawney had driven everything  else out of his head and his brain seemed to be  moving very slowly.
with you ... ?”   “Only if you wish it, of course.”   “If I ...”   And then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered why he had been eager  to come to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office in the first place.
“How is it protected?”   “I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely  wrong.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitated, then said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I  promised you that you could come with me, and I  stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of  me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly  dangerous.”   “I’m coming,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, almost before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had finished speaking.
This  seemed to show on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  moved away from the window and looked more closely  at <PER>Harry</PER>, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
“What has upset you?”   “I’m not upset.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you were never a good Occlumens — ”     The word was the spark that ignited <PER>Harry</PER>’s fury.
He  told <PER>Voldemort</PER> about the prophecy, it was him, he  listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s expression did not change, but <PER>Harry</PER>  thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast  by the setting sun.
“AND YOU LET HIM  TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO  AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!”   Breathing hard as though he was fighting, <PER>Harry</PER>  turned away from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who still had not  moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study,  rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising  every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking  things over.
He wanted to rage and storm at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but he also wanted to go with him to try  and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that  he was a foolish old man for trusting <PER>Snape</PER>, but he  was terrified that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not take him  along unless he mastered his anger.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, biting his lip,  and looked into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s lined face.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> made a terrible — ”         “Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening  at the door!”   “Please let me finish.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER>  had nodded curtly, then went on.
But he did not  know — he had no possible way of knowing — which  boy <PER>Voldemort</PER> would hunt from then onward, or that  the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest  were people that Professor <PER>Snape</PER> knew, that they  were your mother and father — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> let out a yell of mirthless laughter.
Haven’t you  noticed, Professor, how the people <PER>Snape</PER> hates tend  to end up dead?”   “You have no idea of the remorse Professor <PER>Snape</PER> felt  when he realized how Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had interpreted  the prophecy, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And isn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER> convinced that  <PER>Snape</PER>’s on his side, even now?
Professor ... how can  you be sure <PER>Snape</PER>’s on our side?”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not speak for a moment; he looked as  though he was trying to make up his mind about  something.
I trust Severus  <PER>Snape</PER> completely.”         <PER>Harry</PER> breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort  to steady himself.
“He’s up to  something with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> right now, right under  your nose, and you still — ”   “We have discussed this, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  and now he sounded stern again.
“I have told you my  views.”   “You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you  haven’t even considered that <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> might  decide to — ”   “To what?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his eyebrows raised.
Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of  my students seriously, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “I didn’t — ” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>, a little abashed, but  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cut across him.
“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.”   <PER>Harry</PER> bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too  far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went on, “Do you wish  to come with me tonight?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting together in the  common room when he came back.
Then he sped back  down the stairs and into the common room, skidding  to a halt where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat, looking  stunned.
He  did not pause either for <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s gasps of horror or  for <PER>Ron</PER>’s hasty questions; they could work out the  finer details for themselves later.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t be here tonight, so  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s going to have another clear shot at whatever  he’s up to.
No, listen to me!” he hissed angrily, as both  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> showed every sign of interrupting.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  says he’s put extra protection in the school, but if  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s involved, he’ll know what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  protection is, and how to avoid it — but he won’t be  expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?”   “<PER>Harry</PER> — ” began <PER>Hermione</PER>, her eyes huge with fear.
I’d better go,   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s waiting — ”   “No!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> unwrapped the tiny little  bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck.
“We don’t  want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to  be facing?”   “I’ll be fine, I’ll be with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he waited until <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown it  on before saying, “Very good.
“But what will people think when they see you  leaving, Professor?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, his mind on <PER>Malfoy</PER>  and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, as the gates at the  bottom of the drive came into view, “will we be  Apparating?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
A few large chunks of rock, such as the  one upon which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were  standing, looked as though they had broken away  from the cliff face at some point in the past.
Come.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> to the very edge of the  rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds  leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in  water and closer to the cliff.
He watched  as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued to revolve on the spot,  evidently concentrating on things <PER>Harry</PER> could not see.
...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> approached the wall of the cave and  caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring  words in a strange tongue that <PER>Harry</PER> did not  understand.
The entrance  is concealed.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not ask how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed  his wand at <PER>Harry</PER> and at once, <PER>Harry</PER>’s clothes were  as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front  of a blazing fire.
“Thank you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> gratefully, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had already turned his attention back to the solid  cave wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> stayed  quite still; he did not want to break <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  concentration.
So crude.”   “What is it, Professor?”   “I rather think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, putting his  uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a  short silver knife of the kind <PER>Harry</PER> used to chop  potion ingredients, “that we are required to make  payment to pass.”   “Payment?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Blood, if I am not much  mistaken.”   “Blood?”   “I said it was crude,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who sounded  disdainful, even disappointed, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER>  had fallen short of the standards <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  expected.
Once again, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> fails to  grasp that there are much more terrible things than  physical injury.”   “Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it ...” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who  had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more.
“Professor!” protested <PER>Harry</PER>, hurrying forward as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised his knife.
“You are very kind, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now  passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had  made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just  as <PER>Snape</PER> had healed <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wounds.
“After me, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he walked  through the archway with <PER>Harry</PER> on his heels, lighting  his own wand hastily as he went.
“Certainly we could,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, stopping so  suddenly that <PER>Harry</PER> almost walked into him.
Oh ... okay ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected this, but cleared his throat  and said loudly, wand aloft, “Accio Horcruxl”   With a noise like an explosion, something very large  and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty  feet away; before <PER>Harry</PER> could see what it was, it had  vanished again with a crashing splash that made  great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface.
<PER>Harry</PER>  leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart  was still thundering as he turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
That was a very good idea, <PER>Harry</PER>; much the simplest  way of finding out what we are facing.”       “But we don’t know what the thing was,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  looking at the sinisterly smooth water.
...   “Aha,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he stopped again; this  time, <PER>Harry</PER> really did walk into him; for a moment he  toppled on the edge of the dark water, and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s uninjured hand closed tightly around  his upper arm, pulling him back.
Stand back against the  wall, please; I think I have found the place.”         <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> meant; this  patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as  far as he could tell, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to have  detected something special about it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved closer to the water;  <PER>Harry</PER> watched nervously as the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim.
<PER>Harry</PER> gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke  the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and  floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the  bank where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> needed to create a  means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath  of those creatures he had placed within it in case he  ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.”   “So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if  we cross in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s boat?”   “I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they  will, at some point, realize we are not Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> would have been reasonably confident  that none but a very great wizard would have been  able to find the boat,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> would never  have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I  think it unlikely that your powers will register  compared to mine.”   These words did nothing to raise <PER>Harry</PER>’s morale;  perhaps <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew it, for he added,  “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mistake, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mistake ...  Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates  youth.
... Now, you first this time, and be careful not  to touch the water.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood aside and <PER>Harry</PER> climbed carefully  into the boat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!”   “Yes, I am sure you did,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?”   But <PER>Harry</PER> had his answer before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could  reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of  water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying  faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes  misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his  robes swirling around him like smoke.
“Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placidly, “but we do not need  to worry about them at the moment.”   “At the moment?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, tearing his gaze  from the water to look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Fire,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> added with a smile, in response  to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bewildered expression.
It seemed hours and hours  ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had  given <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> Felix Felicis.
“Careful not to touch the water,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  again as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of the boat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> approached the basin and <PER>Harry</PER>  followed.
“Out of the way, please, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained  silent while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> worked, but after a while  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> withdrew his wand, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt it was  safe to talk again.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> would not want  to kill the person who reached this island.”   <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe it.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to keep his voice reasonable,  “sir, this is <PER>Voldemort</PER> we’re — ”   “I’m sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>; I should have said, he would not  want to immediately kill the person who reached this  island,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected himself.
Do not forget that  Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> believes that he alone knows about  his Horcruxes.”   <PER>Harry</PER> made to speak again, but this time <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the  emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.
“You remember,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the condition on  which I brought you with me?”   <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had  turned green in the reflected light of the basin.
“But what if — ?”       “You swore, did you not, to follow any command I  gave you?”   “Yes, but — ”   “I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?”  “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but — ”   “Well, then,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, shaking back his  sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, “you  have my orders.”   “Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>  desperately.
“Once and for all,  <PER>Harry</PER>, do I have your word that you will do all in your  power to make me keep drinking?”   “Couldn’t — ?”   “Do I have it?”   “But — ”   “ Your word, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “I — all right, but — ”   Before <PER>Harry</PER> could make any further protest,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lowered the crystal goblet into the  potion.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> hoped that he would  not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but  the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had;  when the glass was full to the brim, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted  it to his mouth.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice  strained.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> panted and then spoke in a voice <PER>Harry</PER>  did not recognize, for he had never heard <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  frightened like this.
Here ...”   Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, <PER>Harry</PER>  forced the goblet back toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s mouth  and tipped it, so that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drank the  remainder of the potion inside.
...”   And obediently, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drank, as though it was  an antidote <PER>Harry</PER> offered him, but upon draining the  goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.
“Please  make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it  stop and I’ll never, never again ...”   “This will make it stop, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, his  voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of  potion into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s mouth.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> began to cower as though invisible  torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost  knocked the refilled goblet from <PER>Harry</PER>’s trembling  hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt  them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ...”   “Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said  <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, and once again <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his  eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.
...”   He supported <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s shoulders and again,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drained the glass; then <PER>Harry</PER> was on his  feet once more, refilling the goblet as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  began to scream in more anguish than ever, “I want  to die!
...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drank, and no sooner had he finished  than he yelled, “KILL ME!”   “This — this one will!” gasped <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, who had stood to refill the goblet  again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin,  flung himself down beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and heaved  him over onto his back; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s glasses were  askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed.
“No,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “no, you’re not dead, you  said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up —  Rennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s chest; there was a flash of red light but  nothing happened.
“Renneruate — sir — please — ”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyelids flickered; <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt.
The goblet filled with clear water; <PER>Harry</PER> dropped to  his knees beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raised his head, and  brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty.
“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately,  but he did not think that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could hear  him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing  great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing.
His brain  whirling in panic, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, instinctively, the only  way left to get water, because <PER>Voldemort</PER> had planned  it so ...
“Sir — here!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and lunging forward, he  tipped the water clumsily over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
Still  slashing at the air with his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled,   “ Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl”   But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and  their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked  on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched       toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he  felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless  arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as  they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and  surely, back to the water, and he knew there would  be no release, that he would be drowned, and become  one more dead guardian of a fragment of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  shattered soul.
Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware  that their quarry was leaving as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> led  <PER>Harry</PER> back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with  them, around them, the bewildered Inferi  accompanying them to the water’s edge, where they  slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was shaking all over, thought for a  moment that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might not be able to climb  into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it;  all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the  ring of protective flame around them.
“Sir,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they  were coming at me and I panicked — ”   “Quite understandable,” murmured <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
They reached the bank with a little bump and <PER>Harry</PER>  leapt out, then turned quickly to help <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Don’t worry, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, anxious about  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s extreme pallor and by his air of  exhaustion.
...”   And pulling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s uninjured arm around his  shoulders, <PER>Harry</PER> guided his headmaster back around  the lake, bearing most of his weight.
...”   “Don’t talk now,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, fearing how slurred  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s voice had become, how much his feet  dragged.
They crossed the outer cave, and  <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back into the icy seawater  that filled the crevice in the cliff.
“It’s going to be all right, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> said over and  over again, more worried by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s silence  than he had been by his weakened voice.
...”   “I am not worried, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice  a little stronger despite the freezing water.
“I am with  you.”           THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER   Once back under the starry sky, <PER>Harry</PER> heaved  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> onto the top of the nearest boulder and  then to his feet.
Sodden and shivering, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  weight still upon him, <PER>Harry</PER> concentrated harder  than he had ever done upon his destination:  Hogsmeade.
For a moment,  <PER>Harry</PER> thought that his inexpert Apparition had  thrown <PER>Dumbledore</PER> off balance; then he saw his face,  paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a  streetlamp.
...”   And to <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sank onto the  ground.
“All right then, <PER>Snape</PER> — but I’m going to have to leave  you for a moment so I can — ”   Before <PER>Harry</PER> could make a move, however, he heard  running footsteps.
“If you help me support him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, not  listening to her, “I think we can get him inside — ”   “What has happened?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...   “When did it appear?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and his  hand clenched painfully upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder as he  struggled to his feet.
“Shall I run and fetch — ?”   “No, <PER>Harry</PER> can do it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> raised his wand at once.
<PER>Harry</PER>, put on your  Invisibility Cloak.”         <PER>Harry</PER> pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it  over himself before mounting his broom: Madam  Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub  as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> kicked off from the ground  and rose up into the air.
As they sped toward the  castle, <PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ready  to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark  Mark seemed to have acted upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> like a  stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes  fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard  flying behind him on the night air.
Had <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s luck run out by now?
As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which  they had walked earlier, <PER>Harry</PER> heard, over the  whistling of the night air in his ears, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  muttering in some strange language again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had already crossed the crenellated  ramparts and was dismounting; <PER>Harry</PER> landed next to  him seconds later and looked around.
“What does it mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue  glinting evilly above them.
Has  someone definitely been — Professor?”   In the dim green glow from the Mark, <PER>Harry</PER> saw  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> clutching at his chest with his blackened  hand.
I shall wait here.”   “But — ”   “You swore to obey me, <PER>Harry</PER> — go!”   <PER>Harry</PER> hurried over to the door leading to the spiral  staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the  iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps  on the other side.
... <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had wordlessly  immobilized <PER>Harry</PER>, and the second he had taken to  perform the spell had cost him the chance of  defending himself.
He merely looked across at his disarmer and said,  “Good evening, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped forward, glancing around quickly to  check that he and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were alone.
Or are you acting alone?”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pale eyes shift back to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in the greenish glare of the Mark.
There are Death  Eaters here in your school tonight.”   “Well, well,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as though <PER>Malfoy</PER> was  showing him an ambitious homework project.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood imprisoned within his  own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of  them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death  Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER> did nothing but stare at Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  who, incredibly, smiled.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, you are not a killer.”   “How do you know?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> at once.
How did you do it?”   But <PER>Malfoy</PER> said nothing: He was still listening to  whatever was happening below and seemed almost as  paralyzed as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“I see,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> kindly, when <PER>Malfoy</PER> neither  moved nor spoke.
“You are afraid to act until they join  you.”   “I’m not afraid!” snarled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, though he still made  no move to hurt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
... A clever plan, a very clever  plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose.”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who bizarrely seemed to draw  courage and comfort from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s praise.
...”   “Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind  that stuff, did you?” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his  legs apparently fading, and <PER>Harry</PER> struggled  fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding  him.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> has been keeping  watch over you on my orders — ”   “He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my  mother — ”   “Of course that is what he would tell you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but     “He’s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t  working for you, you just think he is!”   “We must agree to differ on that, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
It so happens  that I trust Professor <PER>Snape</PER> — ”   “Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> looked nervously over his shoulder  again, then back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who went on: “So  poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own  bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts  student who entered the room unaccompanied?
“I had one and she had the other and I  could send her messages — ”   “Isn’t that the secret method of communication the  group that called themselves <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s Army       used last year?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You care about me saying  ‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?”   “Yes, I do,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw his feet  slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain  upright.
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than  ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the  actual spiral staircase that led to where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart thundered  unheard in his invisible chest.
“So let us discuss your options, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   “My options!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly.
If you were going to kill me, you would have  done it when you first disarmed me, you would not  have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and  means.”         “I haven’t got any options!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and he was  suddenly white as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Because I knew that you  would have been murdered if Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> realized  that I suspected you.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> winced at the sound of the name.
I can help you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”   “No, you can’t,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his wand hand shaking  very badly indeed.
...”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...”         “No, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought he saw it drop by  a fraction —   But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs,  and a second later <PER>Malfoy</PER> was buffeted out of the way  as four people in black robes burst through the door  onto the ramparts.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wandless, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone!
Well done,  <PER>Malfoy</PER>, well done!”   “Good evening, Amycus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly, as  though welcoming the man to a tea party.
Now, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and quickly.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> was showing less resolution than ever.
Come on, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, do it!”   But at that moment there were renewed sounds of  scuffling from below and a voice shouted, “ They’ve  blocked the stairs — Reductol REDUCTOl”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated  all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to  the top of the tower, and, by the sound of it, created a  barrier behind them —   “Now, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man  angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart was hammering so hard it  seemed impossible that nobody could hear him  standing there, imprisoned by <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s spell —  if he could only move, he could aim a curse from  under the cloak —   “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched  the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to  the ramparts burst open once more and there stood  <PER>Snape</PER>, his wand clutched in his hand as his black  eyes swept the scene, from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slumped  against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including  the enraged werewolf, and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“We’ve got a problem, <PER>Snape</PER>,” said the lumpy  Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the boy doesn’t seem able — ”   But somebody else had spoken <PER>Snape</PER>’s name, quite  softly.
<PER>Snape</PER> said nothing, but walked forward and pushed  <PER>Malfoy</PER> roughly out of the way.
<PER>Snape</PER> gazed for a moment at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and there  was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of  his face.
“Severus ... please ...”   <PER>Snape</PER> raised his wand and pointed it directly at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Avada KedavraV’   A jet of green light shot from the end of <PER>Snape</PER>’s wand  and hit <PER>Dumbledore</PER> squarely in the chest.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s  scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving,  he was forced to watch as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was blasted  into the air.
He had to get to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and he had to catch <PER>Snape</PER>.
He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and  stopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly  lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to  have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but  even as he attempted to make out who was fighting  whom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time  to go\” and saw <PER>Snape</PER> disappearing around the corner  at the far end of the corridor; he and <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed  to have forced their way through the fight unscathed.
He was on top of <PER>Harry</PER>  before <PER>Harry</PER> could raise his wand: <PER>Harry</PER> fell  backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the  stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth,  hot greedy breath at his throat —   “Petrificus Totalusl”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a  stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and  onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying  toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the  fight.
<PER>Harry</PER> now saw red  hair flying like flames in front of him: <PER>Ginny</PER> was  locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater,  Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while      she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the  sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever,  pretty — ”   “Impedimenta).” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike  squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed  into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of  sight behind <PER>Ron</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Lupin,  each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater.
Beyond them, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Tonks fighting an enormous  blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all  directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls  around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest  window —   “<PER>Harry</PER>, where did you come from?” <PER>Ginny</PER> cried, but  there was no time to answer her.
<PER>Snape</PER> must not escape, he must catch up  with <PER>Snape</PER> —   “Take that\” shouted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>  glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting  away down the corridor with her arms over her head,  her brother right behind her.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, are you — ?”   “M’all right,” muttered <PER>Neville</PER>, who was clutching his  stomach, “<PER>Harry</PER> ... <PER>Snape</PER> ’n’ <PER>Malfoy</PER> ... ran past ...”         “I know, I’m on it!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, aiming a hex from the  floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was  causing most of the chaos.
He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the  brother and sister and close in on <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>,  who must surely have reached the grounds by now.
<PER>Harry</PER> flew across the entrance hall and out into the  dark grounds: He could just make out three figures  racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond  which they could Disapparate — by the looks of them,  the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of  him, <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> ...
He did not know  what it was but continued to run, not yet near  enough to get a good aim with a curse —   Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and  <PER>Harry</PER> understood: <PER>Hagrid</PER> had emerged from his  cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters  escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred  his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire,  <PER>Harry</PER> sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said:  not <PER>Hagrid</PER> .
...   “Impedimenta).” he yelled as he rolled over again,  crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously  his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell,  tripping up the other; <PER>Harry</PER> leapt to his feet and  sprinted on after <PER>Snape</PER>.
And now he saw the vast outline of <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed  suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was  aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s immense strength and the toughened skin  he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to  be protecting him.
<PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, however, were  still running; they would soon be beyond the gates,  able to Disapparate —   <PER>Harry</PER> tore past <PER>Hagrid</PER> and his opponent, took aim at  <PER>Snape</PER>’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy\”   He missed; the jet of red light soared past <PER>Snape</PER>’s  head; <PER>Snape</PER> shouted, “Run, <PER>Malfoy</PER>\” and turned.
“Cruc — ”   But <PER>Snape</PER> parried the curse, knocking <PER>Harry</PER>  backward off his feet before he could complete it;  <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and scrambled back up again as the  huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendiol” <PER>Harry</PER>  heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light  spilled over all of them: <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house was on fire.
“Cruc — ” yelled <PER>Harry</PER> for the second time, aiming for  the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight,  but <PER>Snape</PER> blocked the spell again.
“You haven’t  got the nerve or the ability — ”   “Incarc — ” <PER>Harry</PER> roared, but <PER>Snape</PER> deflected the spell  with an almost lazy flick of his arm.
Someone was  screaming, he would surely die of this agony, <PER>Snape</PER>  was going to torture him to death or madness —         “No!” roared <PER>Snape</PER>’s voice and the pain stopped as  suddenly as it had started; <PER>Harry</PER> lay curled on the  dark grass, clutching his wand and panting;  somewhere overhead <PER>Snape</PER> was shouting, “Have you  forgotten our orders?
Pushing himself to his feet  again, he staggered blindly toward <PER>Snape</PER>, the man he  now hated as much as he hated <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself —   “Sectum — !”   <PER>Snape</PER> flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet  again; but <PER>Harry</PER> was mere feet away now and he  could see <PER>Snape</PER>’s face clearly at last: He was no  longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed  a face full of rage.
Mustering all his powers of  concentration, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, Levi —   “No, Potter!” screamed <PER>Snape</PER>.
He could hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelling and Fang howling  as <PER>Snape</PER> closed in and looked down on him where he  lay, wandless and defenseless as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  been.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming  cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been  before he had cursed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
I don’t think so ... no!”         <PER>Harry</PER> had dived for his wand; <PER>Snape</PER> shot a hex at it  and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of  sight.
“Kill me like you killed  him, you coward — ”   “DONT — ” screamed <PER>Snape</PER>, and his face was  suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in  as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the  burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!”   And he slashed at the air: <PER>Harry</PER> felt a white-hot,  whiplike something hit him across the face and was  slammed backward into the ground.
As <PER>Harry</PER> raised himself into a  sitting position, his head still swimming from its last  contact with the ground, he saw <PER>Snape</PER> running as  hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind  him and screeching as <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard him  screech —   <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for  his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his  fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he  knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the  time he had located his wand, he turned only to see  the hippogriff circling the gates.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, still dazed, looking around.
...”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s huge, hairy face was swimming above <PER>Harry</PER>,  blocking out the stars.
“Are you?”   “ ’Course I am ... take more’n that ter finish me.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> put his hands under <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and raised  him up with such force that <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet momentarily  left the ground before <PER>Hagrid</PER> set him upright again.
“We should put out your house,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the  charm’s ‘Aguamenti’ ...”   “Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella  and said, “Aguamenti\”   A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip.
<PER>Harry</PER>  raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and  murmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and <PER>Hagrid</PER>  poured water on the house until the last flame was  extinguished.
“Nothin’  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’ be able to put righ’ ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound  of the name.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> ...”   “I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I  heard ’em cornin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> sadly, still staring at  his wrecked cabin.
...”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER> ...”   “But what happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, he killed ...”   “Killed?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
What’re yeh on abou’, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> killed ...  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> simply looked at him, the little of his face that  could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wha’, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “He’s dead.
“<PER>Snape</PER> kill  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — don’ be stupid, <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wha’s made  yeh say tha’?”   “I saw it happen.”   “Yeh couldn’ have.”   “I saw it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> shook his head; his expression was  disbelieving but sympathetic, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew that  <PER>Hagrid</PER> thought he had sustained a blow to the head,  that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a  jinx.
...   “What musta happened was, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> musta told  <PER>Snape</PER> ter go with them Death Eaters,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said  confidently.
“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, as he and  <PER>Harry</PER> approached the castle front, Fang keeping as  close as he could to their ankles.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moan of pain and shock, but he  did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he  reached the place where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lay and  crouched down beside him.
He had known there was  no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind  Curse <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had placed upon him lifted,  known that it could have happened only because its  caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for  seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest  wizard <PER>Harry</PER> had ever, or would ever, meet.
THE PHOENIX LAMENT   “C’mere, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   “No.”   “Yeh can’ stay here, <PER>Harry</PER>.
Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and  shouts and wails stabbed the night, but <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ginny</PER> walked on, back up the steps into the entrance     hall.
“It’s <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s orders,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Everyone’s up  there, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and Lupin and everyone — ”   Fear stirred in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest again: He had forgotten  the inert figures he had left behind.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, who else is dead?”   “Don’t worry, none of us.”   “But the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> said he stepped over a  body — ”   “He stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, he’s alive.”   There was something in her voice, however, that  <PER>Harry</PER> knew boded ill.   “Are you sure?”   “Of course I’m sure ... he’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s  all.
Pushing open  the doors, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Neville</PER> lying, apparently asleep,  in a bed near the door.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Luna, Tonks,  and Lupin were gathered around another bed near  the far end of the ward.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ran to <PER>Harry</PER>  and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking  anxious.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on  Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he  looked grotesque.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how <PER>Snape</PER> had mended <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.
They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and — and Bill  might have some wolfish characteristics from now  on.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> might know something that’d work,  though,” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
Bill fought those  maniacs on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> owes  him, he can’t leave him in this state — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“No!” Lupin looked wildly from <PER>Ginny</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, as  though hoping the latter might contradict her, but  when <PER>Harry</PER> did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair  beside Bill’s bed, his hands over his face.
He turned away and caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye instead,  exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what  <PER>Ginny</PER> had said.
“How did it  happen?”   “<PER>Snape</PER> killed him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He  immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under  the Invisibility Cloak — and then <PER>Malfoy</PER> came  through the door and disarmed him — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> clapped her hands to her mouth and <PER>Ron</PER>  groaned.
“ — more Death Eaters arrived — and then <PER>Snape</PER> —  and <PER>Snape</PER> did it.
According      to <PER>Hagrid</PER> you were with Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when  he — when it happened.
He says Professor <PER>Snape</PER> was  involved in some — ”   “<PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>,” repeated <PER>McGonagall</PER> faintly, falling into the  chair.
“I always thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  must know something about <PER>Snape</PER> that we didn’t.
...”   “He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for  trusting <PER>Snape</PER>,” muttered Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, now  dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a  tartan- edged handkerchief.
but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me explicitly that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s  repentance was absolutely genuine.
“<PER>Snape</PER> passed <PER>Voldemort</PER> the information that  made <PER>Voldemort</PER> hunt down my mum and dad.
Then  <PER>Snape</PER> told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> he hadn’t realized what he       was doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that  they were dead.”   They all stared at him.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> believed <PER>Snape</PER> was sorry  James was dead?
...”   “So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the  Death Eaters’ side?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who wanted every  detail of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s duplicity and infamy, feverishly  collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear  vengeance.
“So they got in through the Room of  Requirement.”   Almost against his will he glanced from <PER>Ron</PER> to  <PER>Hermione</PER>, both of whom looked devastated.
“I messed up, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bleakly.
“We did like  you told us: We checked the Marauder’s Map and we  couldn’t see <PER>Malfoy</PER> on it, so we thought he must be in  the Room of Requirement, so me, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>  went to keep watch on it ... but <PER>Malfoy</PER> got past us.”   “He came out of the room about an hour after we  started keeping watch,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Gives light only to the  holder, remember?”   “Anyway,” <PER>Ginny</PER> went on, “he must have been  checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death  Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw  something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ”   “ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said <PER>Ron</PER>  bitterly.
Obviously <PER>Malfoy</PER> could see because of that hand  thing and was guiding them, but we didn’t dare use  any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and  by the time we’d reached a corridor that was light,  they’d gone.”   “Luckily,” said Lupin hoarsely, “<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and  <PER>Neville</PER> ran into us almost immediately and told us  what had happened.
“But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of  waiting up there alone for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, because he  came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and  was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.”   “So if <PER>Ron</PER> was watching the Room of Requirement  with <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, turning to  <PER>Hermione</PER>, “were you — ?”   “Outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, yes,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>,  her eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna.
He was shouting about Death Eaters in  the castle, I don’t think he really registered that Luna  and I were there at all, he just burst his way into  <PER>Snape</PER>’s office and we heard him saying that <PER>Snape</PER>  had to go back with him and help and then we heard  a loud thump and <PER>Snape</PER> came hurtling out of his  room and he saw us and — and — ”   “What?” <PER>Harry</PER> urged her.
“I was so stupid, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a high-  pitched whisper.
“We went into his office to see if we  could help Professor Flitwick and found him  unconscious on the floor ... and oh, it’s so obvious  now, <PER>Snape</PER> must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we  didn’t realize, <PER>Harry</PER>, we didn’t realize, we just let  <PER>Snape</PER> go!”   “It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,  had you not obeyed <PER>Snape</PER> and got out of the way, he  probably would have killed you and Luna.”   “So then he came upstairs,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was  watching <PER>Snape</PER> running up the marble staircase in  his mind’s eye, his black robes billowing behind him  as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he  ascended, “and he found the place where you were all  fighting.
... <PER>Neville</PER> ran  at it and got thrown up into the air — ”   “None of us could break through,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “and that  massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over  the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely  missing us.
...”   “And then <PER>Snape</PER> was there,” said Tonks, “and then  he wasn’t — ”   “I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death  Eater’s jinx just missed me right afterward and I  ducked and lost track of things,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“We thought they were being chased by the Death  Eaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and  Greyback were back and we were fighting again — I  thought I heard <PER>Snape</PER> shout something, but I don’t  know what — ”   “He shouted, ‘It’s over,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Minerva, is it  true ... Is he really ... ?”   As Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> nodded, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ginny</PER>  move beside him and looked at her.
Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world  had gone mad, he turned around: <PER>Ron</PER> looked as  stunned as he felt and <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  exchanging startled looks.
...”   And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-  colored hair, and the reason she had come running to  find <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when she had heard a rumor  someone had been attacked by Greyback, all  suddenly became clear to <PER>Harry</PER>; it had not been  Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
...”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have been happier than anybody  to think that there was a little more love in the world,”  said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> curtly, just as the hospital  doors opened again and <PER>Hagrid</PER> walked in.
Professor Flitwick’s lyin’ down, but he says he’ll be all  righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn says the  Ministry’s bin informed.”   “Thank you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  standing up at once and turning to look at the group  around Bill’s bed.
I would like  you to join us too.”   As <PER>Hagrid</PER> nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the  room again, she looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”   <PER>Harry</PER> stood up, murmured “See you in a bit” to <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, and followed Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> back down the ward.
It was several minutes before  <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that they were not heading for  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office, but for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s,  and another few seconds before he realized that of  course, she had been deputy headmistress.
After glancing once at this portrait, Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> made an odd movement as though  steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at  <PER>Harry</PER>, her face taut and lined.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” she said, “I would like to know what you and  Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were doing this evening when  you left the school.”   “I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
It  had been here, in this very room, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had told him that he was to confide the contents of  their lessons to nobody but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it might be important,” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell  anyone.”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> glared at him.
“Potter” — <PER>Harry</PER>  registered the renewed use of his surname — “in the  light of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death, I think you  must see that the situation has changed somewhat —     “I don’t think so,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
Madam Rosmerta’s under  the Imperius Curse, she was helping <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the  Death Eaters, that’s how the necklace and the  poisoned mead — ”   “Rosmerta?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> incredulously,  but before she could go on, there was a knock on the  door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick,  and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by         <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was still weeping copiously, his huge  frame trembling with grief.
A decision should  not be made hastily.”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“What are your views, ought Hogwarts to  remain open?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had been weeping silently into his large,  spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation,  now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno,  Professor ... that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the  headmistress ter decide ...”   “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> always valued your views,”  said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> kindly, “and so do I.”   “Well, I’m stayin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, fat tears still leaking  out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into  his tangled beard.
We  could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come  tomorrow if necessary — ”   “What about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral?” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  speaking at last.
“I — I know that it  was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s wish to be laid to rest here, at  Hogwarts — ”   “Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>  fiercely.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — dead?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Someone had already taken it and  left a fake in its place.”   “Already taken — ?”       Wordlessly, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the fake locket from his  pocket, opened it, and passed it to <PER>Ron</PER>.
...   “R.A.B.,” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>, “but who was that?”   “Dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lying back on his bed fully  clothed and staring blankly upwards.
She had  difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, for wizards and witches were pouring  into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched from  a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned,  black-haired woman descended the carriage steps  and threw herself into the waiting <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s arms.
<PER>Harry</PER> was diligently  avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that,  sooner or later, he would be asked again to account  for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s last excursion from Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were spending all  of their time together.
The beautiful weather seemed  to mock them; <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine how it would have  been if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not died, and they had had  this time together at the very end of the year, <PER>Ginny</PER>’s  examinations finished, the pressure of homework  lifted .
"... so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur  happily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze  British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said this.”   “I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he  really is going to marry her,” sighed <PER>Ginny</PER> later that  evening, as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat beside         the open window of the Gryffindor common room,  looking out over the twilit grounds.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”   “Anyone else we know died?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>,  who was perusing the Evening Prophet.
“They’re still looking for <PER>Snape</PER> but no sign ...”   “Of course there isn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who became angry  every time this subject cropped up.
“They won’t find  <PER>Snape</PER> till they find <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and seeing as they’ve  never managed to do that in all this time ...”   “I’m going to go to bed,” yawned <PER>Ginny</PER>.
I could do with  some sleep.”   She kissed <PER>Harry</PER> (<PER>Ron</PER> looked away pointedly), waved  at the other two, and departed for the girls’  dormitories.
The moment the door had closed behind  her, <PER>Hermione</PER> leaned forward toward <PER>Harry</PER> with a  most <PER>Hermione</PER>-ish look on her face.
This mantra seemed to pulse through <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind as  he fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with  cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that he could  not quite reach, though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> helpfully offered  <PER>Harry</PER> a rope ladder that turned to snakes the  moment he began to climb.
He had shown <PER>Hermione</PER> the note inside the locket  the morning after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s death, and although  she had not immediately recognized the initials as  belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she  had been reading, she had since been rushing off to  the library a little more often than was strictly  necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
You see ... she  was <PER>Snape</PER> ’s mother!”   “I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and  there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince  marrying a man called Tobias <PER>Snape</PER>, and then later  an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a     “ — murderer,” spat <PER>Harry</PER>.
Tobias <PER>Snape</PER> was a Muggle from  what it said in the Prophet”   “Yeah, that fits,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
ashamed of his  parentage, trying to make himself feared using the  Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name —  Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> — the Half-Blood Prince — how could  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have missed — ?”   He broke off, looking out the window.
He could not  stop himself dwelling upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s inexcusable  trust in <PER>Snape</PER> ... but as <PER>Hermione</PER> had just  inadvertently reminded him, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had been  taken in just the same.
Anyway,  the book was left in <PER>Snape</PER>’s old classroom, and I’ll bet  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew his mother was called ‘Prince.’ ”         “I should’ve shown the book to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“All that time he was showing me how  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was evil even when he was at school, and I  had proof <PER>Snape</PER> was too — ”   “ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
...”   “None of us could’ve guessed <PER>Snape</PER> would ... you  know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their  own thoughts, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that they, like him,  were thinking about the following morning, when  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body would be laid to rest.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chair was deserted  too; <PER>Harry</PER> thought that perhaps he had not been able  to face breakfast, but <PER>Snape</PER>’s place had been  unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour.
<PER>Harry</PER>  avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall;  <PER>Harry</PER> had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour  was looking for him.
<PER>Harry</PER>  had not spared <PER>Malfoy</PER> much thought.
His animosity  was all for <PER>Snape</PER>, but he had not forgotten the fear in  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he  had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters  arrived.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not believe that <PER>Malfoy</PER> would have  killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Where, <PER>Harry</PER>  wondered, was <PER>Malfoy</PER> now, and what was <PER>Voldemort</PER>  making him do under threat of killing him and his  parents?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the  ribs from <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Then there was  Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs  on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron      in London; Arabella Figg, <PER>Harry</PER>’s Squib neighbor; the  hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird  Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam  Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some  people whom <PER>Harry</PER> merely knew by sight, such as the  barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed  the trolley on the Hogwarts Express.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> filed into seats at  the end of a row beside the lake.
The  crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of  affection for both of them, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Neville</PER> being  helped into a seat by Luna.
had responded to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s summons the  night that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew  why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see  Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front       row with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“In there,” whispered <PER>Ginny</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming  with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet  spangled with golden stars, was what <PER>Harry</PER> knew to  be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body.
A sharp pain rose in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  throat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music  and the knowledge that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body was so  close seemed to take all warmth from the day.
Tears were falling thick  and fast into both <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s laps.
Now he retreated down the  aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises  that drew scandalized looks from some, including,  <PER>Harry</PER> saw, Dolores Umbridge ... but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that      <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have cared.
He tried to make a  friendly gesture to <PER>Hagrid</PER> as he passed, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s  eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see  where he was going.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at the back row to  which <PER>Hagrid</PER> was heading and realized what was  guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and  trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the  giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed,  docile, almost human.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sat down next to his  half-brother, and Grawp patted <PER>Hagrid</PER> hard on the  head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground.
It had little to do with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> had  known him.
He remembered <PER>Dumbledore</PER> crouching at  the water’s edge two years ago, very close to where  <PER>Harry</PER> now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the  Merchieftainess.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had learned Mermish.
And <PER>Harry</PER> remembered his first  nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had  ever encountered the thing that was then <PER>Voldemort</PER>,  and how he had faced him, and how he and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had discussed fighting a losing battle not  long thereafter.
...   And <PER>Harry</PER> saw very clearly as he sat there under the  hot sun how people who cared about him had stood  in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his  godfather, and finally <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, all determined to  protect him; but now that was over.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>: <PER>Ron</PER>’s  face was screwed up as though the sunlight were  blinding him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face was glazed with tears,  but <PER>Ginny</PER> was no longer crying.
And she thought  you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more —  myself.”   “Smart girl, that <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to  smile.
<PER>Ron</PER>, he saw, was now holding <PER>Hermione</PER>  and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his  shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long  nose.
With a miserable gesture, <PER>Harry</PER> got up, turned  his back on <PER>Ginny</PER> and on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s tomb, and  walked away around the lake.
The Ministry can add two and  two, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Glad to hear it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He  didn’t want people to know.”   “Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said  Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his  irritation with difficulty, “but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is gone,  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I see you are — ”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s man through and through,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>  could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation  waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the  sobbing <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Grawp, who were still in their  seats.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were hurrying toward  <PER>Harry</PER>, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite  direction.
“Wanted me to give him inside information on  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.”   <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to struggle with himself for a moment,  then he said loudly to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Look, let me go  back and hit Percy!”   “No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
What d’you reckon, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gaped at him, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said sadly, “I knew  you were going to say that.
But then what will you  do?”         ‘Tm going back to the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ once more, because  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted me to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes,  haven’t I?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his eyes upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of  the lake.
“Well be there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
His hand closed automatically around the fake  Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the  dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for  himself, in spite of the final meeting with <PER>Voldemort</PER>  he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year,  or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that  there was still one last golden day of peace left to  enjoy with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Most of the  eyes around the table followed <PER>Snape</PER>, and it was to  him that <PER>Voldemort</PER> spoke first.
“So?”   “My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter from his current place of safety on  Saturday next, at nightfall.”       The interest around the table sharpened palpably:  Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at <PER>Snape</PER>  and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER>, however,  looked calmly back into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face and, after a  moment or two, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s lipless mouth curved into  something like a smile.
“My Lord.”   Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table  at <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“My Lord, I have heard differently.”   Yaxley waited, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not speak, so he  went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will  not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the  boy turns seventeen.”   <PER>Snape</PER> was smiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,”  said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an  entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy     <PER>Voldemort</PER> held up a large white hand, and Yaxley  subsided at once, watching resentfully as <PER>Voldemort</PER>  turned back to <PER>Snape</PER>.
If Potter  Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know  immediately.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “He will not do either,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
That Potter lives is due more to my errors  than to his triumphs.”   The company around the table watched <PER>Voldemort</PER>  apprehensively, each of them, by his or her  expression, afraid that they might be blamed for  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s continued existence.
At  her touch, <PER>Malfoy</PER> put his hand into his robes,  withdrew a wand, and passed it along to <PER>Voldemort</PER>,  who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it  closely.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> made an  involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it  seemed he expected to receive <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand in  exchange for his own.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> stroked       the creature absently with long thin fingers, still  looking at Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“We did  desire it — we do.”   To <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her  eyes averted from <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the snake.
To his  right, his son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had been gazing up at the  inert body overhead, glanced quickly at <PER>Voldemort</PER>  and away again, terrified to make eye contact.
This brat has nothing to do with either of  us, nor any beast she marries.”   “What say you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” asked <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and though  his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the  catcalls and jeers.
“Will you babysit the cubs?”   The hilarity mounted; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked in terror at  his father, who was staring down into his own lap,  then caught his mother’s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “Enough,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking the angry snake.
...”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand, pointed it  directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over  the table, and gave it a tiny flick.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “And you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” asked <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking the  snake’s snout with his wand-free hand.
“Severus ... please ... please ...”   “Silence,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, with another twitch of  <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling        IN MEMORIAM   <PER>Harry</PER> was bleeding.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was  wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered  over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the  impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying <PER>Harry</PER>,  whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
Never  once had he imagined <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s childhood or  youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as  <PER>Harry</PER> had known him, venerable and silver-haired  and old.
The idea of a teenage <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was  simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid <PER>Hermione</PER>  or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent  even, but after all, it had been common knowledge  that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had taken part in that legendary  duel with Grindelwald, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not thought to  ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what that had been like, nor about  any of his other famous achievements.
No, they had  always discussed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s past, <PER>Harry</PER>’s future,  <PER>Harry</PER>’s plans ... and it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> now, despite  the fact that his future was so dangerous and so  uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable  opportunities when he had failed to ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  more about himself, even though the only personal  question he had ever asked his headmaster was also  the only one he suspected that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not  answered honestly:   “ What do you see when you look in the mirror?”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “/?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the  Prophet to suppress news about <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
But old  Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because  I’ve had access to a source most journalists would  swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in  public before and who was close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of  his youth.”   The advance publicity for Skeeter’ s biography has  certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store  for those who believe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to have led a  blameless life.
Yes, Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had an  extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy  family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.”   I ask whether Skeeter is referring to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the  Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor  scandal fifteen years ago.
As I reveal in chapter  sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already  discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ‘borrowed’ his papers.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      But the importance of some of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  achievements cannot, I venture, be denied.
I am probably one of the only people       alive who can say that they know the real <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter.”   Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still  circulating about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s final hours.
“You took your time!” roared Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> when  <PER>Harry</PER> appeared at the top of the stairs.
They were dressed for traveling:  Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling     a neat salmon-colored coat, and <PER>Dudley</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s  large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s  favorite moment had been the one when Uncle  Vernon, unaware that <PER>Dudley</PER> had added his  dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been  unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the  boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much  swearing.
“According to you,” Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> said now,  resuming his pacing up and down the living room,  “we — Petunia, <PER>Dudley</PER>, and I — are in danger.
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet  again, “that this Lord Thing — ”       “ — <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “and we’ve  been through this about a hundred times already.
This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you last  year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley — ”   Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> hunched his shoulders angrily, and  <PER>Harry</PER> guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward  off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days  into <PER>Harry</PER>’s summer holidays, of two fully grown  wizards.
The Order is sure  <PER>Voldemort</PER> will target you, whether to torture you to  try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by  holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”   Uncle Vernon’s and <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes met.
Aunt  Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; <PER>Dudley</PER> was  staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They will  torture and kill you like they did my parents !”   “Dad,” said <PER>Dudley</PER> in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going  with these Order people.”   “<PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “for the first time in your life,  you’re talking sense.”   He knew that the battle was won.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      Back in his bedroom, <PER>Harry</PER> fiddled aimlessly with his  rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through  the bars of Hedwig’s cage.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the  moment <PER>Harry</PER> had opened the door; a small man in a  mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow.
The  <PER>Dursley</PER>s did not look at all happy to be addressed  thus; <PER>Harry</PER> half expected another change of mind.
“Mad-Eye will  explain.”   The <PER>Dursley</PER>s, who had listened to all of this with  looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped  as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry up\” <PER>Harry</PER> looked  all around the room before realizing that the voice  had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.
“We are attempting to time  your departure from the house with your family’s  Disapparition, <PER>Harry</PER>; thus, the charm breaks at the      moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the  <PER>Dursley</PER>s.
She clearly felt that it  would be tactless for them to remain in the room  while <PER>Harry</PER> and the <PER>Dursley</PER>s exchanged loving,  possibly tearful farewells.
“There’s no need,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, but Uncle Vernon  made any further explanation unnecessary by saying  loudly,   “Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”   He swung his right arm upward to shake <PER>Harry</PER>’s  hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face  it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it  backward and forward like a metronome.
<PER>Dudley</PER> did not answer, but stood there with his  mouth slightly ajar, reminding <PER>Harry</PER> a little of the  giant, Grawp.
<PER>Dudley</PER> raised a large, hamlike hand to point at  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon,  turning to glare at <PER>Harry</PER> and adding, “You don’t want  to, do you?”   “Not in the slightest,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Right, <PER>Dudley</PER>, let’s get  in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry.”   Again, Vernon <PER>Dursley</PER> marched as far as the front  door, but <PER>Dudley</PER> did not follow.
<PER>Harry</PER> had met this attitude  before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his  closest living relatives took so little interest in the  famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
The unique  position you hold in the hearts of the anti-<PER>Voldemort</PER>  movement?”   “Er — no, they don’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They think I’m a  waste of space, actually, but I’m used to — ”   “I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”   If <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Dudley</PER>’s lips move, he might  not have believed it.
As it was, he stared at <PER>Dudley</PER> for  several seconds before accepting that it must have  been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing,   <PER>Dudley</PER> had turned red.
“Well ... er ... thanks, <PER>Dudley</PER>.”       Again, <PER>Dudley</PER> appeared to grapple with thoughts too  unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “You saved  my life.”   “Not really,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Hestia Jones gave her  an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt  Petunia ran forward and embraced <PER>Dudley</PER> rather  than <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He only said he didn’t think <PER>Harry</PER> was a  waste of space!”   “Yeah, but coming from <PER>Dudley</PER> that’s like ‘I love you,’  ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, torn between annoyance and a desire to  laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at <PER>Dudley</PER>  as if he had just saved <PER>Harry</PER> from a burning building.
<PER>Harry</PER> — ”   He tripped forward and wrung <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand with both  of his own.
“Our thoughts go with you.”   “I hope everything’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with a glance  toward Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Dudley</PER> gently released himself from his mother’s  clutches and walked toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who had to  repress an urge to threaten him with magic.
“Blimey, <PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> over Aunt Petunia’s  renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different  personality into you?”   “Dunno,” muttered <PER>Dudley</PER>.
“See you, <PER>Harry</PER>.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “Yeah ...” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking <PER>Dudley</PER>’s hand and  shaking it.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling        THE SEVEN POTTERS   <PER>Harry</PER> ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at  the window just in time to see the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’ car  swinging out of the drive and off up the road.
Long ago, when he had  been left alone while the <PER>Dursley</PER>s went out to enjoy  themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare  treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the  fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s      computer, or put on the television and flicked through  the channels to his heart’s content.
But <PER>Harry</PER> could  still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even  in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of  green light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly  crashed the car when <PER>Harry</PER> had recounted it — a  flying motorbike .
There was a general cry of greeting as  <PER>Hermione</PER> flung her arms around him, <PER>Ron</PER> clapped  him on the back, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, “All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Let’s get undercover before we  talk you through it.”   <PER>Harry</PER> led them all back into the kitchen where,  laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat  themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work  surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless  appliances: <PER>Ron</PER>, long and lanky; <PER>Hermione</PER>, her  bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George,  grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-  P a g e | 48 <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his  spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-  legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its  socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite  shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur,  slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde  hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-shouldered; <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked  to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and  Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with  his droopy basset hound’s eyes and matted hair.
“So what are we going to do?”   “We’re going to use the only means of transport left to  us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we  don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms,  thestrals, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s motorbike.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> could see flaws in this plan; however, he held  his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address  them.
“Imagine if something went wrong and we  were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> did not smile.
“Funny,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “really amusing.”   “If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled  Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its  socket as he glared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself into  seven.”   <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Hermione</PER>’s eye and looked away at  once.
“So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who grimaced at him in a just-  do-it sort of way.
“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle,  <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, before catching sight of <PER>Ron</PER>’s  raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh,  you know what I mean — Goyle ’s potion looked like  bogies.”   “Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,”  said Moody.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in  front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.
“Altogether, then ...”   <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus  drank.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and  Mundungus were shooting upward; <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and  George were shrinking; their hair was darkening,  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward  into their skulls.
“I knew <PER>Ginny</PER> was lying about that tattoo,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  looking down at his bare chest.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, your eyesight really is awful,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  as she put on glasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be  traveling with me, by broom — ”   “Why’m I with you?” grunted the <PER>Harry</PER> nearest the  back door.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked reassured as she answered  Kingsley’s smile; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> too  lacked confidence on a broomstick.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Ron</PER> did not look quite as pleased as <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Is this Sirius’s bike?”   “The very same,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, beaming down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“An’ the last time yeh was on it, <PER>Harry</PER>, I could fit yeh  in one hand!”   <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but feel a little humiliated as he  got into the sidecar.
“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, quite  oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER>’s discomfort.
“Hold tight now, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Tonks, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw  <PER>Ron</PER> throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before  placing his hands on either side of her waist.
“No — NO!”   The motorbike zoomed forward; <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed  hooded Death Eaters scattering as <PER>Hagrid</PER> blasted  through their circle.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, TURN  AROUND!”   “My job’s ter get you there safe, <PER>Harry</PER>!” bellowed  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he opened the throttle.
“Stop — STOP!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, but as he looked back  again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four  Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and  were pursuing them, aiming for <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s broad back.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping  up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and  <PER>Harry</PER> had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them.
“Hold on, <PER>Harry</PER>, this’ll do for ’em!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER> looked up just in time to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> slamming  a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge.
More Killing Curses flew past <PER>Harry</PER>’s head from the  two remaining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming  for <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> responded with further Stunning  Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower  of multicolored sparks, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought wildly of  fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no  idea what was happening —   “Here we go again, <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and  he jabbed at a second button.
“This’ll do it, <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on tight!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER> saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple  button beside the speedometer.
“It’s all righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, now thrown flat  onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was  steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist  violently in the bike’s slipstream.
‘Tm on it, <PER>Harry</PER>, don’ worry!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelled, and from  inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink  umbrella.
Let me!”   “REPAROl”   There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke  away from the bike completely: <PER>Harry</PER> sped forward,  propelled by the impetus of the bike’s flight, then the  sidecar began to lose height —   In desperation <PER>Harry</PER> pointed his wand at the sidecar  and shouted, “Wingardium Leviosal”   The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least  still airborne: He had but a split second’s relief,  however, as more curses streaked past him: The three  Death Eaters were closing in.
“I’m cornin’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelled from out of the  darkness, but <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the sidecar beginning  to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he  pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and  yelled, “Impedimental”   The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For  a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in  midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One  of his fellows almost collided with him —   Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the  remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to <PER>Harry</PER>  that he had to duck below the rim of the car,  knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat —   “I’m cornin’, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m cornin’!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      A huge hand seized the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes and  hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; <PER>Harry</PER>  pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself  onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to-  back with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “I  shouldn’ta tried ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no  room — ”   “It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted  back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the  darkness, drawing closer.
As the curses came shooting across the intervening  space again, <PER>Hagrid</PER> swerved and zigzagged: <PER>Harry</PER>  knew that <PER>Hagrid</PER> did not dare use the dragon-fire  button again, with <PER>Harry</PER> seated so insecurely.
He shot another  blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater  swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the  red light of his next Stunning Spell, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the  strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan —   “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’s happened?” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of  here!”   “Hold on tight, then, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the  white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: <PER>Harry</PER> felt  himself slipping backward off what little of the seat he  had, <PER>Hagrid</PER> flung backward upon him, barely  maintaining his grip on the handlebars —   “I think we’ve lost ’em <PER>Harry</PER>, I think we’ve done it!”  yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
...   “We’re nearly there, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve nearly made it!”  shouted <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a  Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two  Killing Curses missed <PER>Harry</PER> by millimeters, cast from  behind —   And then <PER>Harry</PER> saw him.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was flying like  smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to  hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the  blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again —   <PER>Hagrid</PER> let out a bellow of fear and steered the  motorbike into a vertical dive.
A  hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he  saw it raise its arm —   “NO!”   With a shout of fury <PER>Hagrid</PER> launched himself off the  bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, <PER>Harry</PER> saw both  <PER>Hagrid</PER> and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their  combined weight too much for the broomstick —   Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees,  <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> scream, “Mine\”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      It was over: He could not see or hear where <PER>Voldemort</PER>  was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out  of the way and heard, “Avada — ”   As the pain from <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar forced his eyes shut,  his wand acted of its own accord.
The remaining Death  Eater yelled; <PER>Voldemort</PER> screamed, “ No\ Somehow,  <PER>Harry</PER> found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire  button.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> called, holding on to the bike for dear  life.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> — Accio <PER>Hagrid</PER>l”   The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth.
Looking  sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure  they would be the last thing he ever saw: <PER>Voldemort</PER>  preparing to curse him once more —   And then <PER>Voldemort</PER> vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down  and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> spread-eagled on the ground below  him.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      5      FALLEN WARRIOR     “<PER>Hagrid</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to raise himself out of the debris of  metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands  sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand.
Are you <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not recognize the man’s voice.
Crashed in  the garden!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling     <PER>Harry</PER>’s head was swimming.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> — ”   “Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on  <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and pushing him back against the  cushions.
They shouldn’t be able to get within a  hundred yards of the place in any direction.”   Now <PER>Harry</PER> understood why <PER>Voldemort</PER> had vanished;  it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed  the barrier of the Order’s charms.
He only hoped they  would continue to work: He imagined <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a  hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for  a way to penetrate what <PER>Harry</PER> visualized as a great  transparent bubble.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!”   Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra,  he covered the floor between them in two strides and  pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a hug that nearly cracked his newly  repaired ribs.
I can’t believe — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER> broke off.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>  said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?”   “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The Portkey ’s through here,” he added to        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, where’s Hedwig?”   “She ... she got hit,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
She had a  great old life — ”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush  glowed bright blue, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> only just got his  forefinger to it in time.
With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible  hook and line had dragged him forward, <PER>Harry</PER> was  pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his  finger glued to the Portkey as he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> hurtled  away from Mr. Tonks.
Throwing aside the no longer glowing  hairbrush, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up, swaying slightly, and saw  Mrs. Weasley and <PER>Ginny</PER> running down the steps by  the back door as <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had also collapsed on  landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.
“We were surrounded the moment we took off —  they knew it was tonight — I don’t know what  happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it  was all we could do to get away, and then <PER>Voldemort</PER>  caught up with us — ”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the  plea for her to understand why he did not know what  had happened to her sons, but —   “Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling  him into a hug he did not feel he deserved.
You and <PER>Hagrid</PER> were  third and,” she checked her watch, “if they made it,  George and Lupin ought to be back in about a  minute.”   Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy,  which she handed to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
As the lamplight fell across  George’s head, <PER>Ginny</PER> gasped and <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach  lurched: One of George’s ears was missing.
No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than  Lupin grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> by the upper arm and dragged  him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where  <PER>Hagrid</PER> was still attempting to ease his bulk through  the back door.
“What creature sat in the corner the first time that  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?” he said,  giving <PER>Harry</PER> a small shake.
“The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use  only.”   “None of the Order would have told <PER>Voldemort</PER> we  were moving tonight,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
If  he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the  start I was the one with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER> caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply.
How did you escape?”   <PER>Harry</PER> explained briefly how the Death Eaters  pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the  true <PER>Harry</PER>, how they had abandoned the chase, how  they must have summoned <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who had  appeared just before he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> had reached the  sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.
Expelliarmus  saved me from <PER>Voldemort</PER> two years ago,” <PER>Harry</PER> added  defiantly.
Lupin was reminding him of the sneering  Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at <PER>Harry</PER>  for wanting to teach <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army how to  Disarm.
Expelliarmus is a useful spell, <PER>Harry</PER>, but  the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature  move, and I urge you not to let it become so!”   Lupin was making <PER>Harry</PER> feel idiotic, and yet there  was still a grain of defiance inside him.
“That’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s job.”   Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in  squeezing through the door, <PER>Hagrid</PER> staggered to a  chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him.
Lupin dived for  the back door; <PER>Harry</PER> leapt over <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s legs and  sprinted into the yard.
Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as <PER>Harry</PER>  ran toward them he realized they were <PER>Hermione</PER>, now  returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley,  both clutching a bent coat hanger.
<PER>Hermione</PER> flung  herself into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms, but Kingsley showed no  pleasure at the sight of any of them.
Over <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  shoulder <PER>Harry</PER> saw him raise his wand and point it  at Lupin’s chest.
“The last words Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke to the pair  of us?”   “ ‘<PER>Harry</PER> is the best hope we have.
“Who else is back?”   “Only <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, George, and me.”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      <PER>Hermione</PER> stifled a little moan behind her hand.
“ <PER>Snape</PER> ?” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, give us a hand!” called <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely from  the door, in which he was stuck again.
Glad of  something to do, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled him free, then headed  through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting  room, where Mrs. Weasley and <PER>Ginny</PER> were still  tending to George.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> and Kingsley,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son,  now back off if you know what’s good for you!”   <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that  before.
“Hi, <PER>Harry</PER> — you are <PER>Harry</PER>, right?”   “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving closer to the sofa.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ginny</PER> and motioned to her to  accompany him back outside.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Lupin stood  shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence.
None        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      of them looked around when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> joined  their silent vigil.
<PER>Ron</PER> tripped dazedly toward  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Stunned one of the  Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you’re  aiming at a moving target from a flying broom — ”   “You did?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, gazing up at <PER>Ron</PER> with her  arms still around his neck.
“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning  to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Kingsley.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell  backward off his broom and — there was nothing we        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our  own tail — ”     Bill’s voice broke.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had  just risked his own life to save <PER>Harry</PER>’s — <PER>Hagrid</PER>,  whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been  tricked into giving <PER>Voldemort</PER> crucial information in  exchange for a dragon’s egg.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      “I know that — ”     “Mad-Eye wouldn’t want — ”   “I KNOW!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed.
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
My  wand acted of its own accord.”   After a few moments, <PER>Hermione</PER> said gently, “But  that’s impossible, <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped at the  gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown  plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking  of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have known how and why <PER>Harry</PER>’s  wand had acted independently, because <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  always had the answers; he had known about wands,  had explained to <PER>Harry</PER> the strange connection that  existed between his wand and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
But  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his  parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where <PER>Harry</PER>  could never talk to them again.
...”   And <PER>Harry</PER> saw the white hand raise its wand and felt  <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old  man on the floor writhe in agony —   “<PER>Harry</PER>?”       It was over as quickly as it had come: <PER>Harry</PER> stood  shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the  garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling.
It was  several moments before he realized that <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> were at his side.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come back in the house,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  whispered.
“You aren’t still thinking of leaving?”   “Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping  <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
“Are you all right?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, close enough  now to look into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
...”   When he had finished telling them what he had seen,  <PER>Ron</PER> looked appalled, but <PER>Hermione</PER> downright  terrified.
Don’t let  him inside your head too!”        <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      6      THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS   The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in  the days that followed; <PER>Harry</PER> kept expecting to see  him stumping in through the back door like the other  Order members, who passed in and out to relay news.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been doing a bit of research,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
Mrs. Weasley had gone  upstairs to wake <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, while Fleur  had drifted off to take a bath.
“It’s one extra day,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> looked  mutinous.
And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you  about that.”   <PER>Ron</PER> glanced toward the door into the hall to check  that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned  in closer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seem to think that the three of  you are dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a  light, casual tone.
“Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me ... stuff to do,” mumbled  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> know about it, and they  want to come too.”   “What sort of ‘stuff’?”   “I’m sorry, I can’t — ”   “Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to  know, and I’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would  agree!” said Mrs. Weasley.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> don’t have to  come, it’s their choice — ”   “I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped,  dropping all pretense now.
From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> so busy with preparations for the  wedding that they hardly had any time to think.
All the jobs she      handed out seemed to keep him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  away from one another; he had not had a chance to  speak to the two of them alone since the first night,  when he had told them about <PER>Voldemort</PER> torturing  Ollivander.
“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of  you getting together and planning, she’ll be able to  delay you leaving,” <PER>Ginny</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone,  as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of  his stay.
“Someone else might kill off  <PER>Voldemort</PER> while she’s holding us here making vol-au-  vents?”   He had spoken without thinking, and saw <PER>Ginny</PER>’s  face whiten.
Mr. Weasley had explained that after  the death of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, their Secret-Keeper, each of      the people to whom <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had confided  Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret-  Keeper in turn.
We can’t expect it to hold  much longer.”   “But surely <PER>Snape</PER> will have told the Death Eaters the  address by now?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> found  himself crammed beside <PER>Ginny</PER>; the unsaid things  that had just passed between them made him wish  they had been separated by a few more people.
“Of course,  none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot  guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey  ’ave ’ad champagne.”   From this, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered that she still suspected  <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Now, <PER>Ron</PER>, have you cleaned out your room yet?”   “ Why?” exclaimed <PER>Ron</PER>, slamming his spoon down and  glaring at his mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> and I are fine with it the way it is!”   “We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few  days’ time, young man — ”   “And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked  <PER>Ron</PER> furiously.
“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER>,  but Mrs. Weasley cut across him.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur  muck out the chickens, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’d be ever so       grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and  Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at  eleven tomorrow morning.”   But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the  chickens.
I’m going to try and put it  all back together again when Molly’s not — I mean,  when I’ve got time.”   When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was  nowhere to be seen, so <PER>Harry</PER> slipped upstairs to  <PER>Ron</PER>’s attic bedroom.
Oh, it’s you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in  relief, as <PER>Harry</PER> entered the room.
The  room was just as messy as it had been all week; the  only change was that <PER>Hermione</PER> was now sitting in the  far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her  feet, sorting books, some of which <PER>Harry</PER> recognized  as his own, into two enormous piles.
“And how did you manage to get away?”   “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>’s mum forgot that she asked <PER>Ginny</PER> and me  to change the sheets yesterday,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” <PER>Ron</PER> told  <PER>Harry</PER>.
But we’re being realistic!”   For the first time, <PER>Harry</PER> imagined Mad-Eye’s body,  broken as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s had been, yet with that one  eye still whizzing in its socket.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I wasn’t trying to upset — ”   But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, <PER>Ron</PER>  bounded off the bed and got there first.
Looking  rather pleased with himself, <PER>Ron</PER> handed the slightly  smoking handkerchief to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried as <PER>Harry</PER>  wrenched the book from <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg and retied it shut.
“I forgot we’ll be hunting down <PER>Voldemort</PER> in  a mobile library.”   “Ha ha,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking down at Spellman’s  Syllabary.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at  him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral that you  wanted to come with me,” <PER>Harry</PER> began.
“Here he goes,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>, rolling his eyes.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, you listen,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>  got back off the bed, put his arm around her once  more, and frowned at <PER>Harry</PER> as though reproaching       him for lack of tact.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not think of anything  to say, not least because it was highly unusual for  <PER>Ron</PER> to be teaching anyone else tact.
“I — <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m sorry — I didn’t — ”   “Didn’t realize that <PER>Ron</PER> and I know perfectly well  what might happen if we come with you?
<PER>Ron</PER>, show <PER>Harry</PER> what you’ve done.”   “Nah, he’s just eaten,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, come here.”   For the second time <PER>Ron</PER> withdrew his arm from  around <PER>Hermione</PER> and stumped over to the door.
“C’mon.”   “Why?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, following <PER>Ron</PER> out of the room  onto the tiny landing.
“Come  and have a look at him.”   <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> up the few short steps into the  tiny attic space.
It was  human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now  that <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes became used to the darkness, was  clearly an old pair of <PER>Ron</PER>’s pajamas.
They climbed back down the ladder,  which <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the ceiling, and rejoined  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was still sorting books.
“It is!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clearly frustrated that <PER>Harry</PER> had not  grasped the brilliance of the plan.
<PER>Ron</PER> sat watching her, and <PER>Harry</PER>  looked from one to the other, unable to say anything.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy  napkin ring,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
I know you said you wanted to go  to Godric’s Hollow first, <PER>Harry</PER>, and I understand why,  but ... well ... shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our  priority?”   “If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d  agree with you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who did not believe that  <PER>Hermione</PER> really understood his desire to return to  Godric’s Hollow.
Perhaps it  was simply because it was there that he had survived  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the  challenge of repeating the feat, <PER>Harry</PER> was drawn to  the place where it had happened, wanting to  understand.
“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” <PER>Hermione</PER>  asked.
“Whichever,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “it’d be one less for us to do!”   “Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the  real locket, aren’t we?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to find out  whether or not it’s destroyed.”   “And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a  Horcrux?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “I’ve been researching that.”   “How?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> removed them all, but he — he didn’t  destroy them.”   <PER>Ron</PER> sat up straight, wide-eyed.
“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you  managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?”   “It — it wasn’t stealing!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking from  <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> with a kind of desperation.
And — they zoomed out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s study  window right into the girls’ dormitory.”   “But when did you do this?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, regarding  <PER>Hermione</PER> with a mixture of admiration and  incredulity.
“Just after his — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s — funeral,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> in an even smaller voice.
They flew  straight in through the open window and I — I packed  them.”   She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t  believe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have been angry, it’s not       as though we’re going to use the information to make  a Horcrux, is it?”   “Can you hear us complaining?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
If he  didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet <PER>Voldemort</PER>  got all the instruction he needed from here.”   “Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a  Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
I think you’re right, <PER>Hermione</PER>, that could easily  have been where he got the information.”   “And the more I’ve read about them,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  “the more horrible they seem, and the less I can  believe that he actually made six.
It warns in this  book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by  ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!”   <PER>Harry</PER> remembered what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said about  <PER>Voldemort</PER> moving beyond “usual evil.”   “Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back  together?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
I can’t see <PER>Voldemort</PER>  attempting it somehow, can you?”   “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could answer.
From all that I’ve read, what  <PER>Harry</PER> did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really  foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”   “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
You’ve got to  put it beyond magical repair.”   “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  “why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in  something else?”   “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a  human being.”   Seeing that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked thoroughly  confused, <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried on, “Look, if I picked up  a sword right now, <PER>Ron</PER>, and ran you through with it,   I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”   “Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
It can’t exist without it.”   “That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  remembering ink pouring like blood from the  punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soul as it vanished.
<PER>Ginny</PER> tried to  get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away,  but obviously it came back good as new.”   “Hang on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning.
You’re in trouble if you  get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.”   “I wonder how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> destroyed the ring?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
I never really ...”   His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the  things he should have asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and of  how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to  <PER>Harry</PER> that he had wasted so many opportunities  when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been alive, to find out more ...  to find out everything.
<PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked  and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks  streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; <PER>Ron</PER>  jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate  Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite  wall; and <PER>Harry</PER> instinctively dived for his wand before  realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley,  whose hair was disheveled and whose face was  contorted with rage.
but there are wedding presents stacked  in my room that need sorting out and I was under the  impression that you had agreed to help.”   “Oh yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking terrified as she leapt  to her feet, sending books flying in every direction,   “we will ... we’re sorry ...”       With an anguished look at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>  hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley.
“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained <PER>Ron</PER> in an  undertone, still massaging his head as he and <PER>Harry</PER>  followed.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were feeling  quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and  it was with ill grace that <PER>Ron</PER> stumped back upstairs  to put on matching socks, and <PER>Harry</PER> attempted to  flatten his hair.
Opportunities to make  plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it  was in desperation that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to  escape the overcrowded house.
And how about <PER>Hagrid</PER>?”       “That’d be great,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’        <PER>Harry</PER> was not wearing his glasses; <PER>Ron</PER>’s face  appeared slightly blurred.
“I think <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s looking for him.”   “Poor bloke,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fervently.
“Do me a favor and don’t tell <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Reveling in the removal of his Trace, <PER>Harry</PER> sent <PER>Ron</PER>’s  possessions flying around the room, causing  Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around  his cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> also tried tying the laces of his  trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several  minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the  pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on <PER>Ron</PER>’s  Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.
“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” <PER>Ron</PER> advised <PER>Harry</PER>,  sniggering when <PER>Harry</PER> immediately checked it.
“I’m afraid that one  isn’t new like <PER>Ron</PER>’s, it was actually my brother  Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his  possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but — ”      The rest of her speech was lost; <PER>Harry</PER> had got up and  hugged her.
“Happy birthday, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, hurrying  into the kitchen and adding her own present to the  top of the pile.
“Come on, then, open <PER>Hermione</PER>’s!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not linger at the table,  as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and  Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.
“I’ll pack these for you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said brightly,  taking <PER>Harry</PER>’s presents out of his arms as the three of  them headed back upstairs.
“I’m nearly done, I’m just  waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of  the wash, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a  door on the first-floor landing.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, will you come in here a moment?”   It was <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> came to an abrupt halt, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> took him by the elbow and tugged him on  up the stairs.
Feeling nervous, <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Ginny</PER>  into her room.
A desk  stood facing the open window, which looked out over  the orchard where he and <PER>Ginny</PER> had once played  two-a-side Quidditch with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  which now housed a large, pearly white marquee.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked up into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, took a deep breath,  and said, “Happy seventeenth.”   “Yeah ... thanks.”   She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it  difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a  brilliant light.
“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to  remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela  when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.”   “I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty  thin on the ground, to be honest.”   “There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she  whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had  never kissed him before, and <PER>Harry</PER> was kissing her  back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than  firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world,  <PER>Ginny</PER>, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one  in her long, sweet-smelling hair —   The door banged open behind them and they jumped  apart.
“Sorry.”   “<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was just behind him, slightly out of  breath.
There was a strained silence, then <PER>Ginny</PER> said  in a flat little voice,   “Well, happy birthday anyway, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears were scarlet; <PER>Hermione</PER> looked nervous.
All the reasons for ending his  relationship with <PER>Ginny</PER>, for staying well away from  her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with <PER>Ron</PER>,  and all happy forgetfulness was gone.
<PER>Ron</PER> marched downstairs, through the still-crowded  kitchen and into the yard, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept pace with  him all the way, <PER>Hermione</PER> trotting along behind them  looking scared.
Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown  lawn, <PER>Ron</PER> rounded on <PER>Harry</PER>.
What are you doing now, messing  her around?”   “I’m not messing her around,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as  <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up with them.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — ”   But <PER>Ron</PER> held up a hand to silence her.
You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t  because I wanted to.”         “Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just  going to get her hopes up again — ”   “She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s  not expecting us to — to end up married, or — ”   As he said it, a vivid picture formed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind of  <PER>Ginny</PER> in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and  unpleasant stranger.
“Okay?”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked  backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then  said, “Right then, well, that’s ... yeah.”   <PER>Ginny</PER> did not seek another one-to-one meeting with  <PER>Harry</PER> for the rest of the day, nor by any look or  gesture did she show that they had shared more than  polite conversation in her room.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s birthday dinner would have stretched the  Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the  arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, several  tables were placed end to end in the garden.
“Nice,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as with one final flourish of her  wand, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned the leaves on the crabapple  tree to gold.
“You’ve really got an eye for that sort of  thing.”   “Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking both  pleased and a little confused.
He had a funny notion that he  would find a chapter on compliments when he found  time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to  Charm Witches; he caught <PER>Ginny</PER>’s eye and grinned at  her before remembering his promise to <PER>Ron</PER> and  hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur  Delacour.
Over her  shoulder, <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> the thumbs-up and  mouthed, Good one.
Although Lupin smiled as he shook  <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, <PER>Harry</PER> thought he looked rather  unhappy.
“Six years ter the day  since we met, <PER>Harry</PER>, d’yeh remember it?”   “Vaguely,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning up at him.
“Didn’t you  smash down the front door, give <PER>Dudley</PER> a pig’s tail,  and tell me I was a wizard?”   “I forge’ the details,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> chortled.
“All righ’, <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “We’re fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Bin busy, we got some newborn  unicorns, I’ll show yeh when yeh get back — ” <PER>Harry</PER>  avoided <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s gazes as <PER>Hagrid</PER>  rummaged in his pocket.
They’re rare,  them.”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, thanks!”         “ ’S’nothin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> with a wave of a dustbin-lid-  sized hand.
“Also with Mr. <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley and Miss  <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.”   “Us?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding surprised.
“There will be no need for you to accompany us,  Arthur.”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with  Mrs. Weasley as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up.
Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that  Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> to squeeze side by side onto the sofa.
If you two”       — he pointed at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> — “can wait  upstairs, I will start with <PER>Ron</PER>ald.”   “We’re not going anywhere,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, while  <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded vigorously.
“I am here, as I’m sure you know,  because of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another.
You were not aware then that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left you anything?”   “A-all of us?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Me and <PER>Hermione</PER> too?”   “Yes, all of—”   But <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted.
Right?”   “Would you say you were close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>ald?” asked Scrimgeour, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It was always <PER>Harry</PER> who ...”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, to see  <PER>Hermione</PER> giving him a stop-talking-now\ sort of look,  but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as  though he had heard exactly what he had expected,  and wanted, to hear.
...”   “You’re being modest, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was very fond of you.”   This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far  as <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never been  alone together, and direct contact between them had  been negligible.
He put his hand inside his cloak and  drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the  one <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>.
... ‘To  <PER>Ron</PER>ald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the  hope that he will remember me when he uses it.’ ”   Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that <PER>Harry</PER>  had seen before: It looked something like a silver  cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to  suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a  simple click.
After  squinting at <PER>Ron</PER> for a moment or two, he turned back  to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will.
He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”         “Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing  secret messages, with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”     “No, I didn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still wiping her eyes on  her sleeve.
They were wedged together so  tightly that <PER>Ron</PER> had difficulty extracting his arm to  put it around <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders.
“ ‘To <PER>Harry</PER> James Potter,’ ” he read, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s  insides contracted with a sudden excitement, “ ‘I leave  the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at  Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of  perseverance and skill.’ ”   As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized  golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly,  and <PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling a definite sense of  anticlimax.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, answered: <PER>Harry</PER>  thought that answering questions correctly was such  a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the  urge.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together; both  considered <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Quidditch knowledge  negligible.
It occurs to me that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who  had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other  faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it  will open only for you.”         <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart was beating rather fast.
Scrimgeour, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to gaze  avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still  hoping it might transform in some way.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left you a second  bequest, Potter.”   “What is it?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, excitement rekindling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both stiffened.
The sword of Godric  Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as  such, belongs — ”   “It belongs to <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hotly.
“That does not make it the exclusive  property of Mr. Potter, whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> may  have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly  shaven cheek, scrutinizing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why do you think  — ?”   “ — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to give me the sword?” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, struggling to keep his temper.
Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he         believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to  destroy <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>?”   “Interesting theory,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Scrimgeour limped  toward <PER>Harry</PER> and jabbed him hard in the chest with  the point of his wand: It singed a hole in <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-  shirt like a lit cigarette.
“Oi!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, jumping up and raising his own wand,  but <PER>Harry</PER> said,   “No!
Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from <PER>Harry</PER>,  glancing at the hole he had made in <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-shirt.
After a minute or so she called, “He’s  gone!”   “What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking  around at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> as Mrs. Weasley  came hurrying back to them.
“To give us what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Everyone exclaimed over the  Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and  lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to  pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any  suggestion as to why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have left  <PER>Harry</PER> an old Snitch.
“Meet us upstairs,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>,  while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to  its normal state.
“After everyone’s gone to bed.”   Up in the attic room, <PER>Ron</PER> examined his Deluminator,  and <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mokeskin purse, not with  gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently  worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s  Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and  R.A.B.’s locket.
“And  from what they said, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> invented it himself!”   “I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out  in his will just to help us turn out the lights!”   “D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate  his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked  <PER>Harry</PER>.
Leaving <PER>Harry</PER> an old Snitch — what the hell  was that about?”   “I’ve no idea,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“When Scrimgeour  made you take it, <PER>Harry</PER>, I was so sure that something  was going to happen!”   “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his pulse quickening as he  raised the Snitch in his fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however,  gasped, pointing frantically from <PER>Harry</PER> to the Snitch  and back again until he found his voice.
Engraved upon  the smooth golden surface, where seconds before  there had been nothing, were five words written in the  thin, slanting handwriting that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s:       I open at the close.
“ ‘I open at the close ...’ What’s that supposed to  mean?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shook their heads, looking blank.
“Why did he want <PER>Harry</PER> to  have the sword?”   “And why couldn’t he just have told me?” <PER>Harry</PER> said  quietly.
“And as for this book,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “The Tales of  Beedle the Bard ... I’ve never even heard of them!”         “You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?”  said <PER>Ron</PER> incredulously.
The circumstance of <PER>Ron</PER>  having read a book that <PER>Hermione</PER> had not was  unprecedented.
“Come off it!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking in disbelief from <PER>Harry</PER>  to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty     “<PER>Ron</PER>, you know full well <PER>Harry</PER> and I were brought up  by Muggles!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
THE WEDDING     Three o’clock on the following afternoon found <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George standing outside the great  white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of  the wedding guests.
George was left to  deal with the middle-aged witches and <PER>Ron</PER> took  charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague  Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to <PER>Harry</PER>’s  lot.
While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and <PER>Hagrid</PER>  shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, <PER>Harry</PER>  hurried back to the entrance to find <PER>Ron</PER> face-to-face  with a most eccentric-looking wizard.
“<PER>Ron</PER> can laugh,” said Luna serenely as <PER>Harry</PER> led her  and Xenophilius toward their seats, “but my father  has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.”   “Really?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had long since decided not  to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views.
Well, well, find me a good  seat, <PER>Ron</PER>ald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought  not to be on my feet too long.”   <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a meaningful look as he passed and  did not reappear for some time: When next they met  at the entrance, <PER>Harry</PER> had shown a dozen more  people to their places.
“He used to down an entire  bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor,  hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of  flowers out of his — ”   “Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>,  while <PER>Harry</PER> roared with laughter.
They were all laughing so much that none of them  noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with  a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until       he held out his invitation to <PER>Ron</PER> and said, with his  eyes on <PER>Hermione</PER>, “You look vunderful.”   “Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded  bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate  to its size.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had no grudge against Krum, shook  hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to  remove Krum from <PER>Ron</PER>’s vicinity, offered to show him  his seat.
While people were still  craning their necks to get a good look at him, <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George came hurrying down the  aisle.
“Time to sit down,” Fred told <PER>Harry</PER>, “or we’re going to  get run over by the bride.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took their seats in the  second row behind Fred and George.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked  rather pink and <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears were still scarlet.
After a       few moments he muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Did you see he’s  grown a stupid little beard?”   <PER>Harry</PER> gave a noncommittal grunt.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong  voice, and with a slight shock, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the same  small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill         and Fleur.
“But I  must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.”   <PER>Ginny</PER> glanced around, grinning, winked at <PER>Harry</PER>,  then quickly faced the front again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s mind  wandered a long way from the marquee, back to  afternoons spent alone with <PER>Ginny</PER> in lonely parts of  the school grounds.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned  and beamed at <PER>Harry</PER>; her eyes too were full of tears.
“Well have time later,” shrugged <PER>Ron</PER>, snatching three  butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
Nowhere near Muriel — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> led the way across the empty dance floor,  glancing left and right as he went: <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure that  he was keeping an eye out for Krum.
<PER>Hermione</PER> aimed a kick at him under the table, but  caught <PER>Harry</PER> instead.
“Gregorovitch!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, and Krum started,  but <PER>Harry</PER> was too excited to care; the memory had  come back to him at the sight of Krum’s wand:  Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before  the Triwizard Tournament.
So  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was looking for a celebrated wandmaker,  and <PER>Harry</PER> did not have to search far for a reason: It  was surely because of what <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had done  on the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had pursued him across  the skies.
He wanted to find  <PER>Ron</PER>, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but <PER>Ron</PER> was  dancing with <PER>Hermione</PER> out in the middle of the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned up against one of the golden pillars and  watched <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was now dancing with Fred and  George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful  about the promise he had given <PER>Ron</PER>.
Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a  drunken uncle of <PER>Ron</PER>’s who seemed unsure whether  or not <PER>Harry</PER> was his son, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted an old wizard  sitting alone at a table.
He was vaguely familiar:  Racking his brains, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that this  was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the  Phoenix and the writer of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s obituary.
I am ashamed to say that I became  rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which       resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast  upon my sanity.”   “Well, in that interview,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “Rita Skeeter  hinted that Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was involved in the  Dark Arts when he was young.”   “Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once.
Let nothing tarnish your memories of  Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt,  not reassured, but frustrated.
Perhaps Doge suspected <PER>Harry</PER>’s feelings, for he  looked concerned and hurried on, “<PER>Harry</PER>, Rita  Skeeter is a dreadful — ”   But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.
Numbly <PER>Harry</PER>  thought of how the <PER>Dursley</PER>s had once shut him up,  locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the  crime of being a wizard.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to  think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet  all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana  had been ill. <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have intervened if such  cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet  there was undoubtedly something odd about the  story.
The <PER>Dumbledore</PER>s  moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she  was their neighbor.”   “The <PER>Dumbledore</PER>s lived in Godric’s Hollow?”   “Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie  Muriel testily.
Never once, in six years,  had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that they had both lived  and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, are you  okay?”         <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where to begin, but it did not  matter.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  jumped to their feet and drew their wands.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> threw themselves into the  panicking crowd.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, where are you?”   As they pushed their way across the dance floor,  <PER>Harry</PER> saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in  the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands  raised, and heard both of them shout, “Protego\”, a  cry that was echoed on all sides —        “<PER>Ron</PER>!
<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> called, half sobbing as she and  <PER>Harry</PER> were buffeted by terrified guests: <PER>Harry</PER> seized  her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a  streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a  protective charm or something more sinister he did  not know —   And then <PER>Ron</PER> was there.
He caught hold of  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s free arm, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt her turn on the  spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness  pressed in upon him; all he could feel was <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  hand as he was squeezed through space and time,  away from the Burrow, away from the descending  Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from <PER>Voldemort</PER>  himself.
A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group  of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER> were still wearing dress robes.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we haven’t got anything to change into,”  <PER>Ron</PER> told her, as a young woman burst into raucous  giggles at the sight of him.
“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...”  said <PER>Harry</PER>, frowning at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was carrying  nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which  she was now rummaging.
“Yes, they’re here,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and to <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER>’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of  jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally  the silvery Invisibility Cloak.
...”   “When did you do all this?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked as <PER>Ron</PER>  stripped off his robes.
“Please, <PER>Harry</PER>,  get that Cloak on!”   <PER>Harry</PER> threw the Invisibility Cloak around his  shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing  from sight.
“It’s you they’re after, <PER>Harry</PER>, and we’ll just  put everyone in even more danger by going back.”   “She’s right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who seemed to know that  <PER>Harry</PER> was about to argue, even if he could not see his  face.
“Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after  everyone.”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, then remembered that they could not  see him, and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of <PER>Ginny</PER>,  and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.
“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court  Road?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m  sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not  where they’ll expect us to be.”   “True,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking around, “but don’t you feel a  bit — exposed?”   “Where else is there?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, cringing as  the men on the other side of the road started wolf-  whistling at her.
Ditch  ginger and come and have a pint!”   “Let’s sit down somewhere,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said hastily as  <PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to shout back across the road.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped into a booth first  and <PER>Ron</PER> sat next to him opposite <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had  her back to the entrance and did not like it: She  glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared  to have a twitch.
After a minute or two, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “You know, we’re not  far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing  Cross — ”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, we can’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
The gum-chewing  waitress shuffled over and <PER>Hermione</PER> ordered two  cappuccinos: As <PER>Harry</PER> was invisible, it would have  looked odd to order him one.
<PER>Ron</PER>, a few seconds  late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the  table, pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> sideways onto her bench.
The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the  tiled wall where <PER>Ron</PER>’s head had just been, as <PER>Harry</PER>,  still invisible, yelled, “Stupefyl”   The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a  jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious.
His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell,  fired another at <PER>Ron</PER>: Shining black ropes flew from  his wand-tip and bound <PER>Ron</PER> head to foot — the  waitress screamed and ran for the door — <PER>Harry</PER> sent  another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the  twisted face who had tied up <PER>Ron</PER>, but the spell  missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the  waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.
He turned over the darker  Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved  rapidly between <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Lock the door,” he told her, “and <PER>Ron</PER>, turn out the  lights.”   He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking  fast as the lock clicked and <PER>Ron</PER> used the  Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER>  could hear the men who had jeered at <PER>Hermione</PER>  earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.
“What are we going to do with them?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered  to <PER>Harry</PER> through the dark; then, even more quietly,  “Kill them?
“Take care of the other one and the waitress while  <PER>Ron</PER> and I clear up.”   “Clear up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking around at the partly  destroyed cafe.
“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you  packed my old jeans, they’re tight.”   “Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>, and as she  dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows,  <PER>Harry</PER> heard her mutter a suggestion as to where <PER>Ron</PER>  could stick his wand instead.
“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on  you, do you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “He can’t have,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Don’t be silly, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> can get in there!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him —  and even if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as  <PER>Hermione</PER> began to argue, “so what?
I swear, I’d like  nothing better than to meet <PER>Snape</PER>!”   “But — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, where else is there?
Then, on <PER>Harry</PER>’s count of three, they  reversed the spells upon their three victims, and  before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could  do more than stir sleepily, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  had turned on the spot and vanished into the  compressing darkness once more.
Number twelve was visible to them, for they had  been told of its existence by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, its Secret-  P a g e | 190 <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few  yards that they were not being followed or observed.
“So where are these jinxes they put up against  <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“We’re not <PER>Snape</PER>!” croaked <PER>Harry</PER>, before  something whooshed over him like cold air and his  tongue curled backward on itself, making it  impossible to speak.
<PER>Ron</PER> was making retching  noises; <PER>Hermione</PER> stammered, “That m-must have b-  been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for  <PER>Snape</PER>!”   Gingerly <PER>Harry</PER> took another step forward.
Something  shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and  before any of them could say another word, a figure  had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and  terrible: <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed and so did Mrs. Black,  her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding  toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair  and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken,  fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar,  dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at  <PER>Harry</PER>.
We  didn’t kill you — ”   On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud  of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, <PER>Harry</PER> looked  around to see <PER>Hermione</PER> crouched on the floor by the  door with her arms over her head, and <PER>Ron</PER>, who was  shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the  shoulder and saying, “It’s all r-right.
“That ... that was ...” <PER>Hermione</PER> whimpered, as <PER>Ron</PER>  helped her to her feet.
Just something to scare <PER>Snape</PER>.”   Had it worked, <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, or had <PER>Snape</PER> already  blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had  killed the real <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
I know they can’t get in the house,  but — what’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned  again as something flashed across his mind like a  bright light on water.
“What did you see?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked, advancing on <PER>Harry</PER>.
Was he cursing  someone?”   “No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt badgered, confused, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not  help as she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar,  again?
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t want you  to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it  down, that’s why you were supposed to use  Occlumency!
Otherwise <PER>Voldemort</PER> can plant false  images in your mind, remember — ”   “Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER> through  gritted teeth; he did not need <PER>Hermione</PER> to tell him  that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had once used this selfsame  connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor  that it had resulted in Sirius’s death.
He turned his back on <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, pretending  to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on  the wall.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked: <PER>Harry</PER> drew his  wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus  soar through the drawing room window and land  upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into  the weasel that spoke with the voice of <PER>Ron</PER>’s father.
<PER>Ron</PER> let out  a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped  onto the sofa: <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him, gripping his arm.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder, “I — ”   “It’s not a problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sickened by the pain  in his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sickened by what he had seen, by  the use to which <PER>Malfoy</PER> was now being put by  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
There was a sharp rap on the door, and <PER>Harry</PER> jumped  as <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice rang out.
A chink of sky was  visible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool,  clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night  and dawn, and everything was quiet except for <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s slow, deep breathing.
<PER>Ron</PER> had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that  <PER>Hermione</PER> sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that  her silhouette was raised above his.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never mentioned there; he thought  of mysterious objects left without explanation in  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will, and resentment swelled in the  darkness.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> actually cared  about <PER>Harry</PER> at all?
There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and  also (<PER>Harry</PER> had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several  posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell  that they were Muggles because they remained quite  stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and  glazed eyes frozen on the paper.
With a leap of pleasure, <PER>Harry</PER> recognized his father;  his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like  <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and he too wore glasses.
I don’t know  how much to believe, actually, because it seems  incredible that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>   <PER>Harry</PER>’s extremities seemed to have gone numb.
<PER>Harry</PER> distinctly remembered his headmaster telling  him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become  invisible.” Perhaps some less gifted Order member  had needed its assistance, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had acted  as carrier?
It seems incredible that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> —   That <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what?
<PER>Hermione</PER> took it and  read it while <PER>Harry</PER> watched her.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   “And there’s this too.”   He handed her the torn photograph, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the  toy broom.
“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” <PER>Harry</PER>  said, “but it’s not here.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced around.
What were they after, do you  think?”   “Information on the Order, if it was <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I  mean, he was in the Order, wasn’t he?”   “Well then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, keen to discuss his theory,  “what about information on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
She was an  incredible magical historian.”   “And she’s still alive,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “and she lives in  Godric’s Hollow, <PER>Ron</PER>’s Auntie Muriel was talking  about her at the wedding.
Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t  she?”         There was a little too much understanding in the  smile <PER>Hermione</PER> gave him for <PER>Harry</PER>’s liking.
“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your  mum and dad, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the  Horcruxes, would it?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer, and she  rushed on, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I know you really want to go to  Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how  easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday.
When he had finished, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Of  course, I can see why that’s upset you, <PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether  or not it’s true or — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a  malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita  Skeeter?
“He was a Death Eater,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “Sirius told me  about him, he joined up when he was really young  and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they  killed him.”   “That fits!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If he was a Death Eater  he had access to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and if he became  disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring  <PER>Voldemort</PER> down!”   She released <PER>Harry</PER>, leaned over the banister, and  screamed, “<PER>Ron</PER>!
“What?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely; she was still  immersed in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s press clippings.
“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s  where the Seeker ... Never mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, realizing  that nobody was listening: <PER>Ron</PER> was on his hands and  knees, searching under the wardrobe.
“There’s an easier way,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER>  wiped his inky fingers on his jeans.
“Charms to prevent it  being summoned magically, you know.”   “Like <PER>Voldemort</PER> put on the stone basin in the cave,”  said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering how he had been unable to  Summon the fake locket.
“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rallying tone as they walked back  downstairs: As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had become more  discouraged, she seemed to have become more  determined.
That clock  that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that  tried to strangle <PER>Ron</PER>; Regulus might have put them  there to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though  we didn’t realize it at ... at ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“There was a locket.”   “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
<PER>Ron</PER> groaned as he threw  himself into a kitchen chair; <PER>Hermione</PER> closed her  eyes.
“It’s not over yet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he raised his voice  and called, “ Kreacherl”   There was a loud crack and the house-elf that <PER>Harry</PER>  had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out  of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace:  tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him  in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his  batlike ears.
Then he  said, “Yes.”   “Where is it now?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> jubilantly as <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> looked gleeful.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s scream  mingled with Kreacher’s, but <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed louder  than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay  still!”   He felt the elf freeze and released him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let him up!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
"... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER> needed an elf?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, looking  around at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked just as  puzzled as he did.
“I know, but — ”         “Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He  Disapparated!”   “But ... you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that  cave,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “otherwise <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ”   “Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring  <PER>Voldemort</PER> down, but you were still happy to betray  Sirius to <PER>Voldemort</PER>?
...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.
Well, <PER>Voldemort</PER>  did ... and so did Sirius.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had no retort.
He pulled out <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s purse and  took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in  which Regulus had placed the note to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
He then made two low bows to  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, and even gave a funny little spasm in  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s direction that might have been an attempt  at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the  usual loud crack.
By nightfall, <PER>Harry</PER> felt discouraged and  anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy  bread, upon which <PER>Hermione</PER> had tried a variety of  unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.
“Death Eaters, for sure,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> watched from the drawing room windows.
“Reckon they know we’re in here?”        “I don’t think so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though she looked  frightened, “or they’d have sent <PER>Snape</PER> in after us,  wouldn’t they?”   “D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue  tied by Moody’s curse?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
They  know that <PER>Harry</PER> owns the house, after all.”   “How do they — ?” began <PER>Harry</PER>.
Restless and irritable, <PER>Ron</PER> had  developed an annoying habit of playing with the  Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly  infuriated <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was whiling away the wait  for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard  and did not appreciate the way the lights kept  flashing on and off.
“I don’t know I’m doing it!”   “Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy  yourself?”         “What, like reading kids’ stories?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me this book, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “ — and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m  supposed to use it!”   Unable to stand the bickering, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped out of  the room unnoticed by either of them.
“Don’t move!”   He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the  sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open         and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth  dishonoring my house — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> came crashing down the stairs  behind <PER>Harry</PER>, wands pointing, like his, at the  unknown man now standing with his arms raised in  the hall below.
<PER>Ron</PER>  too lowered his wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not.
“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known  as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s  Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as  Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus,  <PER>Harry</PER>, which takes the form of a stag.”   “Oh, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lowering his wand, “but I  had to check, didn’t I?”   “Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher, I quite agree that you had to check.
<PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower  your defenses.”   They ran down the stairs toward him.
“We wondered,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, “whether  <PER>Harry</PER> could still have the Trace on him?”   “Impossible,” said Lupin.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked smug, and  <PER>Harry</PER> felt hugely relieved.
Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture  your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed  him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”         <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>; their expressions  reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt.
They managed to penetrate every defensive  spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they  were completely open about why they’d come.”         “And are they bothering to give an excuse for  torturing <PER>Harry</PER>’s whereabouts out of people?” asked  <PER>Hermione</PER>, an edge to her voice.
He read the  headline over it:   WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT   THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gave roars of outrage, but <PER>Harry</PER>  said nothing.
Nobody but those who had been on top of the  tower when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died knew who had really  killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the  Wizarding world, <PER>Harry</PER> had been seen running from  the place moments after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had fallen.
“The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is       that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius  Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.”   “Why didn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER> declare himself Minister of  Magic?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
Declaring  himself might have provoked open rebellion:  Remaining masked has created confusion,  uncertainty, and fear.”   “And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, “involves warning the Wizarding world against  me instead of <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”   “That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a  masterstroke.
Now that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is dead, you —  the Boy Who Lived — were sure to be the symbol and  rallying point for any resistance to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Nevertheless, unless you can  prove that you have at least one close Wizarding  relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your  magical power illegally and must suffer the  punishment.”   <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then said, “What if  purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s  part of their family?
I’ll tell everyone <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s my  cousin — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> covered <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand with hers and squeezed  it.
“Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>, but I couldn’t let you — ”   “You won’t have a choice,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fiercely, gripping  her hand back.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, as we’re on the run with <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, the most  wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters.
“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, <PER>Harry</PER>, but  the Order is under the impression that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  left you a mission.”   “He did,” <PER>Harry</PER> replied, “and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are  in on it and they’re coming with me.”   “Can you confide in me what the mission is?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked into the prematurely lined face, framed  in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could  return a different answer.
And I must tell you that I believe that we are  facing magic many of us have never encountered or  imagined.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure James would have  wanted me to stick with you.”   “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “I’m not.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared  around the room as though he had been bidden to  memorize it, while <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes swiveled  backward and forward from <PER>Harry</PER> to Lupin.
I did  it against my better judgment and I have regretted it  very much ever since.”         “I see,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “so you’re just going to dump her  and the kid and run off with us?”   Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over  backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that  <PER>Harry</PER> saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the  wolf upon his human face.
“Don’t say that — how could any child be ashamed of  you?”         “Oh, I don’t know, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> begged him, but he continued  to glare into Lupin’s livid face.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” wailed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” <PER>Ron</PER>  told <PER>Harry</PER>.
Broken images  were racing each other through his mind: Sirius  falling through the veil; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> suspended,  broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his  mother’s voice, begging for mercy ...   “Parents,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “shouldn’t leave their kids  unless — unless they’ve got to.”   “<PER>Harry</PER> — ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, stretching out a consoling  hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his  eyes on the fire <PER>Hermione</PER> had conjured.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke, but <PER>Harry</PER>  felt sure that they were looking at each other behind  his back, communicating silently.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  looked sympathetic, <PER>Ron</PER> uncertain.
The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of  the recent scene and with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  unspoken reproaches.
He was sure that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had  resumed their silent communications on the other  side of the Prophet He turned a page loudly, and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s name leapt out at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked above  the picture and saw the headline:   EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING  BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE   by Rita Skeeter   Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse  than he already did, <PER>Harry</PER> began to read:   Proud and haughty, Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not  bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her  husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and  imprisonment in Azkaban.
He was in the  process of lowering the newspaper, to ask <PER>Ron</PER>’s and  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed  around the kitchen.
He hurried to his feet as Kreacher  disentangled himself and, bowing low to <PER>Harry</PER>,  croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief  Mundungus Fletcher, Master.”   Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand;  <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, was too quick for him.
<PER>Ron</PER> got up, panting, and watched as  <PER>Harry</PER> pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus ’s  nose.
“Perhaps just one more, Master <PER>Harry</PER>, for luck?”   <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
There was  a locket there.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth was suddenly dry: He  could sense <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s tension and  excitement too.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw his own shock reflected in  <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces.
He  and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been poring over a sheaf of  scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered  the end of the long kitchen table, but now they  watched <PER>Harry</PER> as he strode toward them and threw  down the newspaper on top of their scattered  parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired  man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that  read:   SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS  HEADMASTER       “No!” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> loudly.
<PER>Snape</PER> in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s study —  Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both <PER>Harry</PER> and  <PER>Ron</PER> jump.
<PER>McGonagall</PER>  and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they  know how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died.
They were at the top of the tower when  <PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, so it’s all friends together.
If the Ministry and <PER>Voldemort</PER> are behind      <PER>Snape</PER> it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching,  or a nice few years in Azkaban — and that’s if they’re  lucky.
“Thanks, Kreacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, flipping over the  Prophet so as not to have to look at <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face.
Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?”   In his mind’s eye <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to see the scarlet  steam engine as he and <PER>Ron</PER> had once followed it by  air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling  scarlet caterpillar.
He was sure <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and  Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps  wondering where he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were, or  debating how best to undermine <PER>Snape</PER> ’s new regime.
Oh, here she is,” <PER>Ron</PER> added,  craning around in his seat to watch <PER>Hermione</PER>  reentering the kitchen.
“Sorry?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> understood.
The painted  image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit  between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one  that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the  circular tower-top room where <PER>Snape</PER> was no doubt  sitting right now, in triumphant possession of  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s collection of delicate, silver magical  instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and,  unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of  Gryffindor.
“<PER>Snape</PER> could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this  house for him,” <PER>Hermione</PER> explained to <PER>Ron</PER> as she  resumed her seat.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>, what else happened today?”   “Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears  navy blue robes.”   “But you never told us that!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped her spoon and pulled toward her  the sheaf of notes and maps that she and <PER>Ron</PER> had  been examining when <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the kitchen.
We’ve been over and over this, I mean,  what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if  you aren’t even bothering to tell us — ”   “Blimey, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I forget one little thing — ”   “You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no  more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be  right now than the Ministry of — ”   “I think we should do it tomorrow,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead, her jaw hanging; <PER>Ron</PER> choked  a little over his soup.
“You aren’t serious,  <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
There’s already a good chance  Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t  open.”   “Unless,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “she’s found a way of opening it  and she’s now possessed.”         “Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil  in the first place,” <PER>Harry</PER> shrugged.
“We know everything important,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on,  addressing <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It’s time to act.”   He could tell from <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces that  they were scared; he was not particularly confident  himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to  put their plan into operation.
I think it should just be me and <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I  thought we’d settled this.”   “It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under  the Cloak, but this is different, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER>  jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated  ten days previously.
If anyone shouldn’t go, it’s <PER>Harry</PER>, he’s got  a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head — ”   “Fine, I’ll stay here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Let me know if you  ever defeat <PER>Voldemort</PER>, won’t you?”   As <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed, pain shot through the  scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Master has not finished his soup, would Master  prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to  which Master is so partial?”   “Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er  — bathroom.”   Aware that <PER>Hermione</PER> was watching him suspiciously,  <PER>Harry</PER> hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the  first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and  bolted the door again.
I must’ve dozed off or — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking deep breaths.
...”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you aren’t supposed to let this happen  anymore!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried, her voice echoing through  the bathroom.
He thought the connection was  dangerous — <PER>Voldemort</PER> can use it, <PER>Harry</PER>!
But I’m going to use it.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ”   “Forget <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“He made  Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.”   “But according to you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got  Ollivander locked up somewhere.
If he’s already got a  wandmaker, what does he need another one for?”   “Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks  Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks  Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did  when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t  know.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanging skeptical looks behind  his back.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you keep talking about what your wand did,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but you made it happen!
And so does <PER>Voldemort</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>!
We both know what really happened!”         They glared at each other: <PER>Harry</PER> knew that he had  not convinced <PER>Hermione</PER> and that she was marshaling  counterarguments, against both his theory on his  wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to  see into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
And if we’re  going to the Ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we  should go over the plan?”   Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, <PER>Hermione</PER> let  the matter rest, though <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure she  would attack again at the first opportunity.
“You look terrible,” was <PER>Ron</PER>’s greeting as he entered  the room to wake <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Disapparated with <PER>Ron</PER> first, then came  back for <PER>Harry</PER>.
When  I’ve Stunned her — ”       “<PER>Hermione</PER>, we know,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sternly.
“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other  two in the alleyway, “we put on the Cloak again — ”   “ — and we wait,” <PER>Ron</PER> finished, throwing it over  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and  rolling his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Nicely done, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, emerging from  behind a bin beside the theater door as <PER>Harry</PER> took off  the Invisibility Cloak.
Magical Maintenance will be  here any second.”   They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda;  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> threw the Invisibility Cloak over  themselves but <PER>Hermione</PER> remained in view, waiting.
As <PER>Hermione</PER> and the wizard headed for the main  road, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> crept along behind them.
Using a repulsed <PER>Hermione</PER> to claw his way back into  a standing position, he turned on the spot and  vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag <PER>Ron</PER>  had snatched from his hand as he went and some  flying chunks of vomit.
Anyway, I’m Reg  Cattermole, according to the label in the back.”   “Now wait here,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still  under the Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with  some hairs for you.”   He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much  longer to <PER>Harry</PER>, skulking alone in the sick-splattered  alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned  Mafalda.
Finally <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> reappeared.
“We don’t know who he is,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, passing  <PER>Harry</PER> several curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home  with a dreadful nosebleed!
“Blimey, that’s scary,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>,  who now towered over him.
“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>,  “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.”   They stepped out of the alleyway together.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined a number of oddly  dressed men descending into what appeared to be an  ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy  black and white.
“You got in all right, then?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered theirs, but nobody  followed them: It was as if they were infectious.
“If I don’t turn up, my wife  — I mean, Cattermole ’s wife — ”   “Well come with you, we should stick together — ”  began <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> shook his head feverishly.
You two  find Umbridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office —  but how do I stop it raining?”         “Try Finite Incantatem,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, “that  should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t,  something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm,  which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim  measure try Impervius to protect his belongings — ”   “Say it again, slowly — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, searching his  pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment  the lift juddered to a halt.
He glanced over at <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> as the lift creaked upward once more;  <PER>Hermione</PER> was now whispering frantic instructions to  <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> give <PER>Ron</PER> a little push and he  hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards,  leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone.
The moment the  golden door had closed <PER>Hermione</PER> said, very fast,  “Actually, <PER>Harry</PER>, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t      think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught  the whole thing — ”     “Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.”   The golden grilles slid apart again and <PER>Hermione</PER>  gasped.
Glancing over his shoulder,  <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s anxious face sinking back out  of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge’s  velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.
As he passed  gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door,       each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name  and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its  complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself  upon him so that the plan he had been carefully  concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four  weeks seemed laughably childish.
Now <PER>Hermione</PER> was stuck in court  proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours;   <PER>Ron</PER> was struggling to do magic that <PER>Harry</PER> was sure  was beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly  depending on the outcome; and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was  wandering around on the top floor when he knew  perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in  the lift.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not  immediately noticed the curly green writing across his  hat — The Life and Lies ofAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — nor  the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita  Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master  or Moron?”   <PER>Harry</PER> opened the book at random and saw a full-page  photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing  immoderately with their arms around each other’s  shoulders.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now with elbow-length hair,  had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on  Krum’s chin that had so annoyed <PER>Ron</PER>.
Perhaps deciding that all he had  seen was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> scratching his nose on the  front of the book, for <PER>Harry</PER> had hastily replaced it      upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk  and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in  the ink pot.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried off up the  corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up  here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless,  remember that poisonous duck?”   Speeding back toward the lifts, <PER>Harry</PER> reviewed his  options.
The first thing to do was to  find <PER>Ron</PER>, and then they could work out a way of  extracting <PER>Hermione</PER> from the courtroom.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, it’s me, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!
Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why  isn’t <PER>Hermione</PER> with you?”         “She had to go down to the courtrooms with  Umbridge, she couldn’t refuse, and — ”   But before <PER>Harry</PER> could finish the lift had stopped  again: The doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked  inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair  was teased so high it resembled an anthill.
He would try to extricate <PER>Hermione</PER> on his own  while <PER>Ron</PER> was dealing with the raining office.
So he moved forward as silently as he  could, and with every step he took numbness seemed  to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think  of <PER>Hermione</PER> and of <PER>Ron</PER>, who needed him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, if you think I was going to sit here and let  her pretend — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, Mrs. Cattermole!”         <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility  Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of  their corners; they were gliding toward the woman  chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus  had vanished or because they sensed that their  masters were no longer in control, they seemed to  have abandoned restraint.
“Get the Horcrux,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, how do I get  rid of these chains?”   “Wait, I’m trying something up here — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, we’re surrounded by dementors!”         “I know that, <PER>Harry</PER>, but if she wakes up and the  locket’s gone — I need to duplicate it — Geminio\  There ... That should fool her.
You’ve seen how it is,  you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how are we going to get out  of here with all those dementors outside the door?”   “Patronuses,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing his wand at his  own: The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming  brightly, toward the door.
“As many as we can  muster; do yours, <PER>Hermione</PER>.”   “Expec — Expecto patronum,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“C’mon,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he led <PER>Hermione</PER> and Mrs.  Cattermole to the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,  they know there are intruders inside the Ministry,  something about a hole in Umbridge’s office door, I  reckon we’ve got five minutes if that — ”       <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she  turned a horror-struck face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if we’re trapped here — !”   “We won’t be if we move fast,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” squeaked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Follow me,” he whispered  to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved  forward in a huddle, shepherded by <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at <PER>Hermione</PER>; he seized her  hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as  Yaxley’s curse sailed over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung open the door; <PER>Ron</PER> was standing  there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs.  Cattermole.
He seized <PER>Hermione</PER> by the  hand and <PER>Ron</PER> by the arm and turned on the spot.
He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he  could not breathe or see and the only solid things in  the world were <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s fingers,  which were slowly slipping away.
Looking around,  <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they and <PER>Hermione</PER> were lying on a  forest floor, apparently alone.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and  for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and  dangerous it would be for them to appear in the  grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of  sneaking through the trees to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut.
However,  in the few moments it took for <PER>Ron</PER> to give a low groan  and <PER>Harry</PER> to start crawling toward him, he realized  that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees        looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the  ground clearer.
He met <PER>Hermione</PER>, also on her hands and knees, at  <PER>Ron</PER>’s head.
The moment his eyes fell upon <PER>Ron</PER>, all  other concerns fled <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, for blood drenched  the whole of <PER>Ron</PER>’s left side and his face stood out,  grayish- white, against the leaf-strewn earth.
“What’s happened to him?”   “Splinched,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her fingers already busy  at <PER>Ron</PER>’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and  darkest.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, horrified, as she tore open <PER>Ron</PER>’s  shirt.
His insides crawled  unpleasantly as <PER>Hermione</PER> laid bare <PER>Ron</PER>’s upper arm,  where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped  cleanly away as though by a knife.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle  labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — ”   “Bag — right — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> sped to the place where <PER>Hermione</PER> had landed,  seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand  inside it.
“Accio Dittany\”   A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he  caught it and hastened back to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>,  whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white  eyeball all that were visible between his lids.
“Unstopper it for me,  <PER>Harry</PER>, my hands are shaking.”   <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the stopper off the little bottle,  <PER>Hermione</PER> took it and poured three drops of the potion  onto the bleeding wound.
Since <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died,  we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve given him the secret,  haven’t I?”   There was no pretending; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure she was  right.
With a twinge of regret  that had nothing to do with food, <PER>Harry</PER> imagined the  house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney  pie that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would never eat.
I couldn’t leave it there ... but that’s how they  knew there were intruders.”   Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, <PER>Ron</PER> groaned and  opened his eyes.
Did <PER>Voldemort</PER> or his henchmen know,  even now, where <PER>Hermione</PER> had taken them?
“D’you reckon we should move on?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>,  and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell by the look on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face that he  was thinking the same.
“If we’re staying, we should put some protective  enchantments around the place,” she replied, and  raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle  around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, murmuring incantations as  she went.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw little disturbances in the  surrounding air: It was as if <PER>Hermione</PER> had cast a  heat haze upon their clearing.
“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so  bad,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now performing complicated  figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so <PER>Ron</PER>’s  dad said I could borrow it.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
Can’t we call him You-Know-Who —  please?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said fear of a name — ” began <PER>Harry</PER>.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-  Who by his name didn’t do <PER>Dumbledore</PER> much good in  the end,” <PER>Ron</PER> snapped back.
“Just — just show You-  Know-Who some respect, will you?”   “Respect?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shot him a  warning look; apparently he was not to argue with  <PER>Ron</PER> while the latter was in such a weakened  condition.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> half carried, half dragged <PER>Ron</PER>  through the entrance of the tent.
That’s what <PER>Harry</PER> told her to do.”   “Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, leaning back  on his pillows.
If they both end  up in Azkaban because of us ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked over at <PER>Hermione</PER> and the question he  had been about to ask — about whether Mrs.  Cattermole ’s lack of a wand would prevent her  Apparating alongside her husband — died in his       throat.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was watching <PER>Ron</PER> fret over the fate  of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in  her expression that <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as if he had  surprised her in the act of kissing him.
He handed the locket back to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, each of whom did their best, but were no  more successful at opening it than he had been.
“What d’you mean?”   <PER>Ron</PER> passed the Horcrux to <PER>Harry</PER>.
After a moment or  two, <PER>Harry</PER> thought he knew what <PER>Ron</PER> meant.
“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” <PER>Harry</PER>  replied, and, little though he wanted to, he hung the  chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out  of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his  chest beside the pouch <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given him.
With the Sneakoscope <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for  his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent,  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent the rest of the day sharing  the role of lookout.
Evening brought  no change; <PER>Harry</PER> lit his wand as he swapped places  with <PER>Hermione</PER> at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a  deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above  him across the single patch of starry sky visible from  their protected clearing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not packed any food in her magical  bag, as she had assumed that they would be  returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had  had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that  <PER>Hermione</PER> had collected from amongst the nearest  trees and stewed in a billycan.
After a couple of  mouthfuls <PER>Ron</PER> had pushed his portion away, looking  queasy; <PER>Harry</PER> had only persevered so as not to hurt  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s feelings.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, now  talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away  if they wanted to: He could not.
Sick images swarmed into <PER>Harry</PER>’s  head and he tried to push these away too, for there  was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and  <PER>Hermione</PER> had already decided against trying to  summon him; what if someone from the Ministry  came too?
And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had fallen ... fallen ...   “ Give it to me, Gregorovitch.”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held  in front of him by a long-fingered white hand.
He always knows.”   The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with  fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until  their blackness swallowed <PER>Harry</PER> whole —   And now <PER>Harry</PER> was hurrying along a dark corridor in  stout little Gregorovitch ’s wake as he held a lantern  aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of  the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked  like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in  the swinging pool of light, and there on the window  ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with  golden hair.
Can you control what you dream about,  <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “If you just learned to apply Occlumency — ”   But <PER>Harry</PER> was not interested in being told off; he  wanted to discuss what he had just seen.
“He’s found Gregorovitch, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I think he’s  killed him, but before he killed him he read  Gregorovitch ’s mind and I saw — ”   “I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired  you’re falling asleep,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coldly.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower  bunk; <PER>Harry</PER> climbed into the one above him, lay  down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling.
After  several moments, <PER>Ron</PER> spoke in a voice so low that it  would not carry to <PER>Hermione</PER>, huddled in the  entrance.
... <PER>Voldemort</PER> had said nothing about <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand,  nothing about the twin cores, nothing about  Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand  to beat <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled  inside the tent; all <PER>Harry</PER> could hear was <PER>Ron</PER>’s  breathing.
After a while, <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, “Couldn’t  you see what the thief was holding?”   “No ... it must’ve been something small.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>?”   The wooden slats of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bunk creaked as he  repositioned himself in bed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after  something else to turn into a Horcrux?”   “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
Didn’t <PER>Hermione</PER> say he had pushed his soul to  the limit already?”   “Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.”   “Yeah ... maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He had been sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been looking  for a way around the problem of the twin cores, sure  that <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought a solution from the old  wandmaker .
...   With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief  who was in danger now, and it was on him that  <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts dwelled, as <PER>Ron</PER>’s snores began to  rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted  slowly into sleep once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> felt that it was best not to stay  anywhere too long, and <PER>Ron</PER> agreed, with the sole  proviso that their next move took them within reach  of a bacon sandwich.
<PER>Hermione</PER> therefore removed the  enchantments she had placed around the clearing,  while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> obliterated all the marks and  impressions on the ground that might show they had  camped there.
“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested  <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived back at the tent empty-  handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word,  dementors.
“So we still haven’t got any food.”   “Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Come on,” she said  impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did  not react, “the Horcrux, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’re still wearing it!”   She held out her hands, and <PER>Harry</PER> lifted the golden  chain over his head.
<PER>Ginny</PER> told me there were times when she  couldn’t remember anything.”   “Hmm,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking down at the heavy  gold locket.
“But we’ll take turns  wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.”   “Great,” said <PER>Ron</PER> irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that  out, can we please get some food?”   “Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> with half a glance at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was least surprised by this,  because he had suffered periods of near starvation at  the <PER>Dursley</PER>s’.
He did not  seem to have any ideas himself, but expected <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> to come up with plans while he sat and  brooded over the low food supplies.
Accordingly <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent fruitless hours trying to decide  where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how  to destroy the one they had already got, their  conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as  they had no new information.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> that he believed  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had hidden the Horcruxes in places  important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of  dreary litany, those locations they knew that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had lived or visited.
He’d already made five  of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was certain the snake is the sixth,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Repressing a strong urge to  throw something at him, <PER>Harry</PER> plowed on, “I still  reckon he might have hidden something at  Hogwarts.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have found it, <PER>Harry</PER>!”         <PER>Harry</PER> repeated the argument he kept bringing out in  favor of this theory.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  to give him a job after he left,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thought he only wanted to come  back to try and find something, probably another  founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had shown <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Voldemort</PER>  sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places;  this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed  as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry  or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with  its golden doors and marble floors.
What did you see?” demanded <PER>Ron</PER>, whenever  he noticed <PER>Harry</PER> wince.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Ron</PER> was hoping  to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of  the Phoenix, but after all, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was not a  television aerial; he could only see what <PER>Voldemort</PER>  was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took  his fancy.
Apparently <PER>Voldemort</PER> was dwelling  endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face,  whose name and whereabouts, <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure,  <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew no better than he did.
As the days stretched into weeks, <PER>Harry</PER> began to  suspect that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were having  conversations without, and about, him.
<PER>Ron</PER> was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and  <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to fear that <PER>Hermione</PER> too was  disappointed by his poor leadership.
The fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> was getting better at  identifying edible fungi could not altogether  compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of  other people’s company, or their total ignorance of  what was going on in the war against <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced automatically at <PER>Ron</PER>’s  neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain  of the Horcrux glinting there.
“ You can do the cooking tomorrow, <PER>Ron</PER>, you can find  the ingredients and try and charm them into  something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull  faces and moan and you can see how you — ”   “Shut up!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, leaping to his feet and holding  up both hands.
<PER>Hermione</PER> snatched up the beaded bag and  started to rummage; after a moment she drew out  three Extendable Ears and threw one each to <PER>Harry</PER>  and <PER>Ron</PER>, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-  colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends  out of the tent entrance.
“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”   Goblins\ <PER>Hermione</PER> mouthed at <PER>Harry</PER>, who nodded.
And  then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?”   “Yeah,” said another voice, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at each other, silent but beside  themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the  voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.
Inside the tent <PER>Harry</PER>’s breathing  was shallow with excitement: He and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared  at each other, listening as hard as they could.
“About  the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of  <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office at Hogwarts?”   An electric current seemed to course through <PER>Harry</PER>,  jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the  spot.
One of the kids who tried to take the sword was  Bill’s younger sister.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced toward <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, both of  whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly  as lifelines.
Or on <PER>Snape</PER> himself?”         “Well, whatever they thought they were going to do  with it, <PER>Snape</PER> decided the sword wasn’t safe where it  was,” said Dirk.
Inside the tent, <PER>Harry</PER> closed his eyes, willing someone  to ask the question he needed answered, and after a  minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he was (<PER>Harry</PER>  remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s  too.
“You believe <PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   “ ’Course I do,” said Ted.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> reeled in the Extendable  Ears.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had found the need to remain silent       increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped,  now found himself unable to say more than, “<PER>Ginny</PER>  — the sword — ”   “I know!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake  while it was in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office,” she panted, as  they propped the painting against the side of the tent,  “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he  hangs right beside the case!”   “Unless he was asleep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but he still held  his breath as <PER>Hermione</PER> knelt down in front of the  empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared  her throat, then said:   “Er — Phineas?
“That sword isn’t  <PER>Snape</PER>’s.”   “It belongs to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s school,” said Phineas  Nigellus.
She deserved her punishment, as did  the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!”   “<PER>Neville</PER> is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
How did <PER>Snape</PER> punish <PER>Ginny</PER>,  <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> urgently.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> sent them into the Forbidden Forest,  to do some work for the oaf, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s not an oaf!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly.
“And <PER>Snape</PER> might’ve thought that was a  punishment,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and  Luna probably had a good laugh with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Goblins’ silver repels  mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens  it.”   “Don’t call <PER>Hermione</PER> simple,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s portrait — couldn’t you bring  him along, here, into yours?”   Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of  <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> cannot  come here with me, and after the treatment I have  received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall  not be making a return visit!”         Slightly crestfallen, <PER>Harry</PER> watched Phineas redouble  his attempts to leave his frame.
“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of  Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> used it to break open a ring.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> has more important things on his  mind than the many eccentricities of Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s  portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had  fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised  a shining face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Goblin-made  blades imbibe only that which strengthen them —  <PER>Harry</PER>, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk  venom!”   “And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t give it to me because he still  needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket — ”   “ — and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you  have it if he put it in his will — ”   “ — so he made a copy — ”   “ — and put a fake in the glass case — ”   “ — and he left the real one — where?”   They gazed at each other; <PER>Harry</PER> felt that the answer  was dangling invisibly in the air above them,  tantalizingly close.
Or had he, in fact, told <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not  realized it at the time?
“Nobody ever goes  in there.”       “But <PER>Snape</PER> knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a  bit risky?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusted <PER>Snape</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded her.
“Yeah, you’re right!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he felt even more  cheered at the thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had had  some reservations, however faint, about <PER>Snape</PER> ’s  trustworthiness.
<PER>Ron</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
For one bewildered moment he  thought that <PER>Ron</PER> had left the tent, then realized that  <PER>Ron</PER> was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking  stony.
Don’t let me spoil your fun.”   Perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> looked to <PER>Hermione</PER> for help, but she  shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was.
There’s no problem,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still  refusing to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dread doused <PER>Harry</PER>’s jubilation: <PER>Ron</PER> was saying  exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be  thinking.
I just hoped, you know, after we’d been  running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved  something.”   “<PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, but in such a quiet voice that  <PER>Ron</PER> could pretend not to have heard it over the loud  tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent.
Did  you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”   “We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted  <PER>Ron</PER>, standing up, and his words pierced <PER>Harry</PER> like  scalding knives.
“We thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told  you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!”   “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, this time clearly audible over  the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he  ignored her.
And in case you  haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux — ”   “Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we  are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near,  in other words!”   “Take off the locket, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, her voice  unusually high.
You wouldn’t be  talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day.”   “Yeah, he would,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who did not want  excuses made for <PER>Ron</PER>.
D’you  think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, we weren’t — ”   “Don’t lie!” <PER>Ron</PER> hurled at her.
“So why are you still here?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, and he took  several steps toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who did not back away.
But  you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the  Forbidden Forest, <PER>Harry</PER> I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter  doesn’t care what happens to her in here — well, I do,  all right, giant spiders and mental stuff — ”   “I was only saying — she was with the others, they  were with <PER>Hagrid</PER> — ”   “Yeah, I get it, you don’t care!
And what about the  rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another  kid injured,’ did you hear that?”   “Yeah, I — ”   “Not bothered what it meant, though?”   “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, forcing her way between them.
“Go back to them, pretend  you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be  able to feed you up and — ”   <PER>Ron</PER> made a sudden movement: <PER>Harry</PER> reacted, but  before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket,  <PER>Hermione</PER> had raised her own.
“Protego\” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded  between her and <PER>Harry</PER> on the one side and <PER>Ron</PER> on  the other; all of them were forced backward a few  steps by the strength of the spell, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>  glared from either side of the transparent barrier as  though they were seeing each other clearly for the  first time.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a corrosive hatred toward <PER>Ron</PER>:  Something had broken between them.
<PER>Ron</PER>, we said we’d go with <PER>Harry</PER>, we said we’d help — ”   “I get it.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still and silent, listening  to her sobbing and calling <PER>Ron</PER>’s name amongst the  trees.
He dragged  blankets off <PER>Ron</PER>’s bunk and threw them over  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped down from  his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who was already busy in the kitchen, did  not wish <PER>Harry</PER> good morning, but turned her face  away quickly as he went by.
And that was the simple truth  of it, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, because their protective  enchantments meant that it would be impossible,  once they vacated this spot, for <PER>Ron</PER> to find them  again.
Finally having entirely  repacked the beaded bag three times, <PER>Hermione</PER>  seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: She  and <PER>Harry</PER> grasped hands and Disapparated,  reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside.
The instant they arrived, <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>’s  hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down  on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with  what he knew were sobs.
<PER>Harry</PER> strode off through the  heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught  <PER>Hermione</PER> at its center, casting the spells she usually  performed to ensure their protection.
<PER>Harry</PER> was determined never to mention his       name again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to know that it  was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at  night when she thought he was sleeping, he would  hear her crying.
However, <PER>Ron</PER> did not appear on the map,  and after a while <PER>Harry</PER> found himself taking it out  simply to stare at <PER>Ginny</PER>’s name in the girls’  dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with  which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that  she would somehow know he was thinking about her,  hoping that she was all right.
Cudgel his brains though he might, <PER>Harry</PER> could not  remember <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever mentioning a place in  which he might hide something.
There were moments  when he did not know whether he was angrier with  <PER>Ron</PER> or with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
They were spending many evenings in near silence,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s  portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he  might fill part of the gaping hole left by <PER>Ron</PER>’s  departure.
He venerated  <PER>Snape</PER>, the first Slytherin headmaster since he  himself had controlled the school, and they had to be  careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions  about <PER>Snape</PER>, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly  leave his painting.
From all of these things, <PER>Harry</PER> deduced that <PER>Ginny</PER>,  and probably <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna along with her, had  been doing their best to continue <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army.
This scant news made <PER>Harry</PER> want to see <PER>Ginny</PER> so  badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him  think of <PER>Ron</PER> again, and of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and of  Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as  his ex-girlfriend.
Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked  about <PER>Snape</PER> ’s crackdown, <PER>Harry</PER> experienced a split      second of madness when he imagined simply going  back to school to join the destabilization of <PER>Snape</PER>’s  regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other  people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful  prospect in the world at that moment.
Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently  emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions  about <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s whereabouts.
They had just eaten an unusually good meal:  <PER>Hermione</PER> had been to a supermarket under the  Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money  into an open till as she left), and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that  she might be more persuadable than usual on a  stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.
He felt exactly as he had  done on the occasion, several years previously, when  he had asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> whether he could  go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not  persuaded the <PER>Dursley</PER>s to sign his permission slip.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ve been thinking, and — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, could you help me with something?”   Apparently she had not been listening to him.
Godric’s Hollow,  Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have expected you to make the  connection?”   “Oh yeah ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to admit that he had not been  thinking about the sword at all when he suggested  they go to Godric’s Hollow.
It was a sticky moment: <PER>Harry</PER>  knew that she had sensed <PER>Ron</PER>’s name in the offing.
What if  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> entrusted it to her?”   <PER>Harry</PER> considered this possibility.
If so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left a great deal  to chance: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never revealed that he  had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so  much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda.
Now,  however, was not the moment to cast doubt on  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly  willing to fall in with <PER>Harry</PER>’s dearest wish.
So, are we going to go to  Godric’s Hollow?”   “Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully,  <PER>Harry</PER>.” She was sitting up now, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell  that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her  mood as much as his.
After <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone to bed that night, <PER>Harry</PER>  quietly extracted his rucksack from <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album  <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given him so long ago.
<PER>Harry</PER> would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow  the following day, but <PER>Hermione</PER> had other ideas.
Convinced as she was that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would expect  <PER>Harry</PER> to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths,  she was determined that they would set off only after  they had ensured that they had the best disguises  possible.
They were to Apparate to the village under cover of  darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally       swallowed Polyjuice Potion, <PER>Harry</PER> transforming into a  balding, middle-aged Muggle man, <PER>Hermione</PER> into his  small and rather mousy wife.
The beaded bag  containing all of their possessions (apart from the  Horcrux, which <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing around his neck)  was tucked into an inside pocket of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  buttoned-up coat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It made <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat constrict, it reminded  him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing  rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of  the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wearing a bonnet he had won in a  cracker, of <PER>Ron</PER> in a hand-knitted sweater.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, here!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> was two rows of tombstones away; he had  to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in  his chest.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help thinking that he and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> both had deep roots in this graveyard,  and that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ought to have told him so, yet  he had never thought to share the connection.
They  could have visited the place together; for a moment  <PER>Harry</PER> imagined coming here with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, of  what a bond that would have been, of how much it  would have meant to him.
But it seemed that to  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the fact that their families lay side by  side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant  coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted  <PER>Harry</PER> to do.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, and he was glad that  his face was hidden in shadow.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, they’re here ... right here.”   And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and  father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if  something heavy were pressing on his chest, the  same sensation he had had right after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his  heart and lungs.
Why is that  there?”   “It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death  Eaters mean it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her voice  gentle.
He put  his arm around <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulders, and she put  hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and  walked away through the snow, past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  mother and sister, back toward the dark church and  the out-of-sight kissing gate.
<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure there’s someone over  there!”     <PER>Harry</PER> thought of A History of Magic ; the graveyard  was supposed to be haunted: what if — ?
<PER>Harry</PER>, who did not feel as  sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring  <PER>Hermione</PER>, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery  pavement.
For a  moment <PER>Harry</PER> considered suggesting they take refuge  inside it, but before he could say anything <PER>Hermione</PER>  murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down  the dark street leading out of the village in the  opposite direction from which they had entered.
<PER>Harry</PER>?”       She tugged at his arm, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not paying  attention.
The hedge had grown wild in the  sixteen years since <PER>Hagrid</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER> from the  rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high  grass.
That <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told her to       wait, and that <PER>Harry</PER> would come in the end?
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, causing <PER>Hermione</PER> to gasp and  jump.
Beneath the Cloak <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at  each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised his eyebrows; <PER>Hermione</PER> gave  a tiny, nervous nod.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m not sure about this,” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped and clutched <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
And  it came to <PER>Harry</PER> instantly where he had seen the boy  before: in The Life and Lies of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, arm  in arm with the teenage <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and that must  be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita’s  book.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what are you doing?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Was there something you wanted to tell us?”   Giving no sign that she had heard <PER>Hermione</PER>, Bathilda  now shuffled a few steps closer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, right ... <PER>Hermione</PER>, I think she wants me to go  upstairs with her.”   “All right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “let’s go.”   But when <PER>Hermione</PER> moved, Bathilda shook her head  with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at  <PER>Harry</PER>, then to herself.
“Maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told her to give the sword to me,  and only to me?”   “Do you really think she knows who you are?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down into the milky eyes  fixed upon his own, “I think she does.”   “Well, okay then, but be quick, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Lead the way,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Bathilda.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced back at  <PER>Hermione</PER> with a reassuring smile, but he was not  sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the  midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the  bookcase.
As <PER>Harry</PER> walked out of the room, unseen  by both <PER>Hermione</PER> and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-   P a g e | 381 <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his  jacket.
From below he  heard <PER>Hermione</PER> call, “<PER>Harry</PER>?”   He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call  back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the  floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular     “No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor.
Frozen air filled the room as <PER>Harry</PER> ducked  to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot  slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand —      He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was  full of the snake, its tail thrashing; <PER>Hermione</PER> was  nowhere to be seen and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> thought  the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash  of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking  <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil  rising up to the ceiling.
Everything  was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and  splintered china flew everywhere as <PER>Harry</PER> jumped  over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be  <PER>Hermione</PER> —   She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across  the bed: The snake reared again, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that  worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps  already at the gate, his head was going to split open  with the pain from his scar —   The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging  <PER>Hermione</PER> with him; as it struck, <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed,   “ ConfringoV’ and her spell flew around the room,  exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back  at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; <PER>Harry</PER> felt the  heat of it sear the back of his hand.
...   And his scream was <PER>Harry</PER>’s scream, his pain was  <PER>Harry</PER>’s pain ... that it could happen here, where it  had happened before ... here, within sight of that  house where he had come so close to knowing what it  was to die ... to die.
“Not <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Harry</PER>, please not <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “Stand aside, you silly girl .
”   “Not <PER>Harry</PER>, please no, take me, kill me instead — ”   “This is my last warning — ”   “Not <PER>Harry</PER>!
...”       “<PER>Harry</PER>, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!”     He was <PER>Harry</PER>.
... <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Voldemort</PER> ... and the  thing that was rustling was not a snake.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
I wanted to go too; I really thought  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have left the sword there for you.”   “Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn’t we?”   “What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?
Please.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this — ”  “Please, <PER>Hermione</PER>, try!”   “R-Reparo.”   The dangling half of the wand resealed itself.
<PER>Harry</PER>  pointed it at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered so quietly he could  hardly hear her.
“We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, the tears trickling down her face.
It was never the same again,  he had to get a new one.”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held  hostage by <PER>Voldemort</PER>; of Gregorovitch, who was dead.
Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left behind —   And his fury at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> broke over him now like  lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other  feeling.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left them  to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown  and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided:   Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they  had no sword, and now, <PER>Harry</PER> had no wand.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened that he might curse her  with her own wand.
Rita.’ I think it must have  arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps  she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?”   “No, she probably wasn’t.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked down upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face and  experienced a surge of savage pleasure: Now he would  know all the things that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never  thought it worth telling him, whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  wanted him to or not.
He soon discovered it and read  greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go  further back to make sense of it all, and eventually he  found himself at the start of a chapter entitled “The  Greater Good.” Together, he and <PER>Hermione</PER> started to  read:         Now approaching his eighteenth birthday,   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory — Head  Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for  Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth  Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-  Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the  International Alchemical Conference in Cairo.
<PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the phoenix wand ...   “<PER>Harry</PER>.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts.
“I’m not trying to defend what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wrote,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The <PER>Dumbledore</PER> we knew would never,  ever have allowed — ”   “The <PER>Dumbledore</PER> we thought we knew didn’t want to  conquer Muggles by force!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, his voice  echoing across the empty hilltop, and several         blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiraling  against the pearly sky.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was  the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always  voted for Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights,  who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who  died trying to bring him down!”   Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that  the face of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled dolefully at  both.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so  angry is that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you any of this  himself.”   “Maybe I am!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and he flung his arms  over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying  to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight  of his own disillusionment.
He  shared a damn sight more of what he was really  thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared  with me.”   <PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s wand, which he had  dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the  entrance of the tent.
But perhaps we ought to Disapparate  under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?”   Half an hour later, with the tent packed, <PER>Harry</PER>  wearing the Horcrux, and <PER>Hermione</PER> clutching the  beaded bag, they Disapparated.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though he was recuperating from  some brief but severe illness, an impression  reinforced by <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s solicitousness.
As  darkness drew in again <PER>Harry</PER> refused <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.
What was it, <PER>Harry</PER> asked himself (walking again),  that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told him the last time he had  retrieved the sword?
“Why the hell,” panted <PER>Ron</PER>, holding up the Horcrux,  which swung backward and forward on its shortened  chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t you take  this thing off before you dived?”       <PER>Harry</PER> could not answer.
As he dragged sweater after sweater  over his head, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Ron</PER>, half expecting him  to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him,  and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the  pool, he had saved <PER>Harry</PER>’s life.
No antlers.”   <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s pouch back around his neck,  pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand, and faced <PER>Ron</PER> again.
“I did think I saw something move over there, but I  was running to the pool at the time, because you’d  gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to  make a detour to — hey!”   <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurrying to the place <PER>Ron</PER> had  indicated.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around,  holding <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand high, and saw the place: a  flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.
When <PER>Ron</PER> offered the sword,  however, <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had at least taught <PER>Harry</PER> something  about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable  power of certain acts.
“Let’s get rid of the damn  thing, it’s been months — ”   “I can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m serious — you do it — ”   “But why?”   “Because that thing’s bad for me!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, backing  away from the locket on the rock.
I’m not making excuses, <PER>Harry</PER>, for what I was like,  but it affects me worse than it affected you and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, it made me think stuff — stuff I was  thinking anyway, but it made everything worse, I      can’t explain it, and then I’d take it off and I’d get my  head on straight again, and then I’d have to put the  effing thing back on — I can’t do it, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side,  shaking his head.
<PER>Ron</PER> raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point  dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and <PER>Harry</PER>  gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already  imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.
...”   “Stab!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>; his voice echoed off the  surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and <PER>Ron</PER>  gazed down into Riddle’s eyes.
Second best, always, eternally  overshadowed ...”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, stab it now!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed: He could feel the  locket quivering in his grip and was scared of what  was coming.
Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there  bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, weirdly distorted.
<PER>Ron</PER> yelled in shock and backed away as the figures  blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists,  then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side  like trees with a common root, swaying over <PER>Ron</PER> and  the real <PER>Harry</PER>, who had snatched his fingers away  from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” he shouted, but the Riddle-<PER>Harry</PER> was now  speaking with <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice and <PER>Ron</PER> was gazing,  mesmerized, into its face.
We laughed at  your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption — ”   “ Presumption?’ echoed the Riddle-<PER>Hermione</PER>, who was  more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real  <PER>Hermione</PER>: She swayed, cackling, before <PER>Ron</PER>, who  looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword hanging  pointlessly at his side.
What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, stab it, STAB IT!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, but <PER>Ron</PER> did not  move: His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-<PER>Harry</PER> and  the Riddle-<PER>Hermione</PER> were reflected in them, their hair  swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their  voices lifted in an evil duet.
“ Your mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-<PER>Harry</PER>, while  Riddle-<PER>Hermione</PER> jeered, “that she would have  preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange ...”   “Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take  you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned  Riddle-<PER>Hermione</PER>, and she stretched like a snake and  entwined herself around Riddle-<PER>Harry</PER>, wrapping him  in a close embrace: Their lips met.
“Do it, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked toward him, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought he saw a  trace of scarlet in his eyes.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — ?”   The sword flashed, plunged: <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself out  of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long,  drawn-out scream.
The monstrous versions of himself and <PER>Hermione</PER>  were gone: There was only <PER>Ron</PER>, standing there with  the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at  the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.
<PER>Harry</PER> crammed the  broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside <PER>Ron</PER>,  and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder.
With you gone ...”   He could not finish; it was only now that <PER>Ron</PER> was  here again that <PER>Harry</PER> fully realized how much his  absence had cost them.
I thought you knew.”   <PER>Ron</PER> did not respond, but turned his face away from  <PER>Harry</PER> and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve.
<PER>Harry</PER>  got to his feet again and walked to where <PER>Ron</PER>’s  enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as <PER>Ron</PER>  had run toward the pool to save <PER>Harry</PER> from drowning.
He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to  <PER>Ron</PER>, who clambered to his feet as <PER>Harry</PER> approached,  eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.
“I’ve been trying to tell you that for  years.”         Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged,  <PER>Harry</PER> gripping the still-sopping back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s jacket.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not wait to wake  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and it was with quickening excitement that  he entered the tent, <PER>Ron</PER> lagging a little behind him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was fast  asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not  move until <PER>Harry</PER> had said her name several times.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed  into a shadowy corner, slipped off <PER>Ron</PER>’s rucksack,  and attempted to blend in with the canvas.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slid out of her bunk and moved like a  sleepwalker toward <PER>Ron</PER>, her eyes upon his pale face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> —  OW!”   “You — complete — arse — <PER>Ron</PER>ald — Weasley!”   She punctuated every word with a blow: <PER>Ron</PER> backed  away, shielding his head as <PER>Hermione</PER> advanced.
“Protegol”   The invisible shield erupted between <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>: The force of it knocked her backward onto  the floor.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Give it back  to me\”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>, will you please — ”   “Don’t you tell me what to do, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” she  screeched.
And  YOU!”       She was pointing at <PER>Ron</PER> in dire accusation: It was  like a malediction, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not blame <PER>Ron</PER> for  retreating several steps.
I begged you  to come back!”   “I know,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m sorry, I’m really —     “Oh, you’re sorry!”   She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound;  <PER>Ron</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> for help, but <PER>Harry</PER> merely  grimaced his helplessness.
“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you  think it’s all going to be all right if you just say  sorry?”   “Well, what else can I say?” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER>  was glad that <PER>Ron</PER> was fighting back.
“Rack your brains, <PER>Ron</PER>, that should only  take a couple of seconds — ”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” interjected <PER>Harry</PER>, who considered this a  low blow, “he just saved my — ”   “I don’t care!” she screamed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re  looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and      mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were  dead, you don’t know what it’s been like — ”     “What it’s been like for you?”   Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to  hear it soon, but she had reached a level of  indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless,  and <PER>Ron</PER> seized his opportunity.
“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated,  but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I couldn’t go anywhere!”   “A gang of what?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw  herself down into a chair with her arms and legs  crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would  unravel them for several years.
...”   <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, clearly hopeful she might  soften at this small instance of humor, but her       expression remained stony above her tightly knotted  limbs.
I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again” — <PER>Ron</PER>  held up his right hand to show two missing  fingernails; <PER>Hermione</PER> raised her eyebrows coldly —  “and I came out miles from where you were.
Oh yes, You-Know- Who’s snake turned  up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-  Who himself arrived and missed us by about a  second.”   “What?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, gaping from her to <PER>Harry</PER>, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> ignored him.
That really puts  our sufferings into perspective, doesn’t it?”   “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, “<PER>Ron</PER> just saved my  life.”   She appeared not to have heard him.
<PER>Harry</PER>  remembered: It had been the first time <PER>Ron</PER>’s name       had been said aloud by either of them since the day  he had left; <PER>Hermione</PER> had mentioned it when talking  about repairing <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand.
And the light went out in my room, but another light  appeared right outside the window.”   <PER>Ron</PER> raised his empty hand and pointed in front of  him, his eyes focused on something neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor  <PER>Hermione</PER> could see.
“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like  that light you get around a Portkey, you know?”   “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together  automatically.
And we left really early, because, as <PER>Harry</PER>  says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.”   “Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Then what happened?”   <PER>Ron</PER> explained how he had watched <PER>Harry</PER> jump into  the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he  had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and  saved <PER>Harry</PER>, then returned for the sword.
“Well, it — it screamed,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with half a glance  at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, <PER>Harry</PER>  removed the Shield Charm with a wave of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  wand and turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers  with a spare wand?”   “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been watching <PER>Hermione</PER>  examining the locket.
“Mine’s broken.”         “You’re kidding?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but at that moment  <PER>Hermione</PER> got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive  again.
<PER>Ron</PER> passed <PER>Harry</PER> the new wand.
Remember  those birds she set on me?”   “I still haven’t ruled it out,” came <PER>Hermione</PER>’s muffled  voice from beneath her blankets, but <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER>  smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out  of his rucksack.
XEN OPHILIUS LOVEGOOD   <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected <PER>Hermione</PER>’s anger to abate  overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she  communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed  silences the next morning.
During those few moments he spent alone  with <PER>Harry</PER>, however (collecting water and searching  the undergrowth for mushrooms), <PER>Ron</PER> became  shamelessly cheery.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant  spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the  appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of  Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, <PER>Ron</PER>’s return, made  <PER>Harry</PER> so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain  a straight face.
Late in the afternoon he and <PER>Ron</PER> escaped <PER>Hermione</PER>’s  baleful presence again, and under the pretense of  scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent  blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange  of news.
<PER>Harry</PER> had finally managed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> the  whole story of his and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s various  wanderings, right up to the full story of what had  happened at Godric’s Hollow; <PER>Ron</PER> was now filling  <PER>Harry</PER> in on everything he had discovered about the  wider Wizarding world during his weeks away.
“But I haven’t got a problem calling  him V — ”   “NO!” roared <PER>Ron</PER>, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to jump into the  hedge and <PER>Hermione</PER> (nose buried in a book at the  tent entrance) to scowl over at them.
“Sorry,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, wrenching <PER>Harry</PER> back out of the brambles, “but  the name’s been jinxed, <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s how they track  people!
“<PER>Harry</PER> ... you don’t reckon it could’ve been  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> what?”   <PER>Ron</PER> looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low  voice, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ... the doe?
I mean,” <PER>Ron</PER> was  watching <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corners of his eyes, “he had  the real sword last, didn’t he?”         <PER>Harry</PER> did not laugh at <PER>Ron</PER>, because he understood  too well the longing behind the question.
Same reason he left you an  old Snitch and <PER>Hermione</PER> a book of kids’ stories?”   “Which is what?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, turning to look <PER>Ron</PER>  full in the face, desperate for the answer.
He —  well,” <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears turned bright red and he became  engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he  prodded with his toe, “he must’ve known I’d run out  on you.”   “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> corrected him.
Partly to  change the subject, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Speaking of       <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, have you heard what Skeeter wrote  about him?”   “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once, “people are talking about  it quite a lot.
’Course, if things were different, it’d be  huge news, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> being pals with Grindelwald,  but now it’s just something to laugh about for people  who didn’t like <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and a bit of a slap in the  face for everyone who thought he was such a good  bloke.
He was really young when they — ”   “Our age,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, just as he had retorted to  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and something in his face seemed to  decide <PER>Ron</PER> against pursuing the subject.
<PER>Harry</PER> took aim at it with the wand <PER>Ron</PER> had  given him the previous night, which <PER>Hermione</PER> had  since condescended to examine, and had decided was  made of blackthorn.
“I’m sorry I said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was young, okay?”   <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten <PER>Ron</PER>’s hatred of spiders.
“You just need to practice,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had  approached them noiselessly from behind and had  stood watching anxiously as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to enlarge  and reduce the spider.
Keen for them all to  be friends again, however, he agreed; but when <PER>Ron</PER>  gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a tentative smile, she stalked off and  vanished behind her book once more.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was lying on her bunk reading,  while <PER>Ron</PER>, after many nervous glances up at her, had  taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack  and started to try and tune it.
For ten minutes or  so <PER>Ron</PER> tapped and muttered, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned the  pages of her book, and <PER>Harry</PER> continued to practice  with the blackthorn wand.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not deign to respond, but approached  <PER>Harry</PER>.
Look at this!”   She thrust The Life and Lies ofAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  under <PER>Harry</PER>’s unwilling eyes and he saw a  photograph of the original letter that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had  written Grindelwald, with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s familiar thin,  slanting handwriting.
“Er — what are you — ?” said <PER>Ron</PER> tentatively, but  <PER>Hermione</PER> quelled him with a look and turned back to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
I’m sure this is important,  <PER>Harry</PER>!”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer immediately.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me  The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re  not supposed to find out about the sign?”   “Here we go again!” <PER>Harry</PER> felt slightly exasperated.
“We keep trying to convince ourselves <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left  us secret signs and clues — ”   “The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,”  piped up <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER>’s right, I think we  ought to go and see Lovegood.”   <PER>Harry</PER> threw him a dark look.
He was quite sure that  <PER>Ron</PER>’s support of <PER>Hermione</PER> had little to do with a  desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.
“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” <PER>Ron</PER> added,  “Lovegood’s on your side, <PER>Harry</PER>, The Quibbler’s been  for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got  to help you!”   “I’m sure this is important!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“But don’t you think if it was, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would  have told me about it before he died?”   “Maybe ... maybe it’s something you need to find out  for yourself,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a faint air of  clutching at straws.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sycophantically, “that makes sense.”   “No, it doesn’t,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but I still think  we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood.
<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure we ought to know about this!”     “I think we should vote on it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Outvoted, <PER>Harry</PER>, sorry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping him on  the back.
Shouldn’t be hard to find.”   When <PER>Hermione</PER> had returned to her bunk, <PER>Harry</PER>  lowered his voice.
And <PER>Ginny</PER>, she’d have been really understanding.”   “But where have you been, then?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>,  surprised.
They walked for a few hours, <PER>Harry</PER>, at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s  insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up  with him, panting and clutching stitches in their  sides, they found him grinning broadly.
“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER>,”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
What do you want?”  he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking  first at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then at <PER>Ron</PER>, and finally at <PER>Harry</PER>,         upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical   O.
“I’m <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”   Xenophilius did not take <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, although the  eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid  straight to the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Why have you come here?”   Before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak, however, <PER>Hermione</PER> let out  a small cry of shock.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, embarrassed, “now’s not  the moment — ”   “But <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s an Erumpent horn!
Now,” he said, turning to  <PER>Harry</PER>, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?”         “We need some help,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before <PER>Hermione</PER>  could start again.
The thing is ... helping <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ... rather  dangerous ...”   “Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s  their first duty to help <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, I agree with <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said,  shoving the tray into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms and joining  <PER>Harry</PER> at the statue’s side.
“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an  armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs  crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?”   “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who nodded  encouragingly, “it’s about that symbol you were  wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur’s  wedding, Mr. Lovegood.
“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”          THE TALE OF THE THREE  BROTHERS   <PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I assume that you are all familiar with “The Tale of  the Three Brothers’?”   <PER>Harry</PER> said, “No,” but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both said,  “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely.
“ ‘And Death spoke to them — ’ ”   “Sorry,” interjected <PER>Harry</PER>, “but Death spoke to them?”  “It’s a fairy tale, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   “Right, sorry.
Whichever term you prefer.”   “But then ... do you mean ...” said <PER>Hermione</PER> slowly,  and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that she was trying to keep any  trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe  these objects — these Hallows — actually exist?”   Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again.
“Well, of course.”   “But,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could hear her  restraint starting to crack, “Mr.
Close-minded.”   “Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress.
She, <PER>Harry</PER>,  and <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at one another, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew that  they were all thinking the same thing.
“I am glad to see  that you are opening your mind a little.”   “So the Elder Wand,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, before  <PER>Hermione</PER> could retort, “you think that exists too?”   “Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said  Xenophilius.
The bloody trail of the Elder  Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding  history.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
My mum’s full of them.”         “<PER>Harry</PER> and I were raised by Muggles,” <PER>Hermione</PER>  reminded him.
“It’s just a  morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one  you’d choose — ”   The three of them spoke at the same time; <PER>Hermione</PER>  said, “the Cloak,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, “the wand,” and <PER>Harry</PER>  said, “the stone.”   They looked at each other, half surprised, half  amused.
“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” <PER>Ron</PER> told  <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if  you had the wand.
An unbeatable wand, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  come on!”   “We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked exasperated: The expression was so  endearingly familiar that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at  each other.
Some wizards  just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better  than other people’s.”   “But how do you know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that those  wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny —  aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries  under different names?”   “What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by  Death?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
...”   Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly  new, is it, but it’s just ... perfect!”   “Yes, all right, but <PER>Ron</PER>, the stone ...”   As they argued in whispers, <PER>Harry</PER> moved around the  room, only half listening.
Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five  beautifully painted faces: <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>,  <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“What’s wrong?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> descended  the staircase, but before he could respond,  Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the  kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> drew their  wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his  pocket.
But they  might give her back to me if I — if I — ”   “Hand over <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> finished for him.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized their  mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways,  shoving <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> out of harm’s way as  Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room  and hit the Erumpent horn.
He heard <PER>Hermione</PER>’s scream, <PER>Ron</PER>’s yell, and a  series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him  that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and  fallen backward down the spiral stairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> gasp, and he had the odd  sensation that something was swooping low over him,  immersing his body in its shadow.
<PER>Ron</PER>  was buried deepest: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed, as  quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where  he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his  legs.
While Xenophilius ’s banging and scraping drew  nearer and nearer, <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to free <PER>Ron</PER>  with the use of a Hover Charm.
“Do you trust me, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
But <PER>Harry</PER> — ”     “Please, <PER>Ron</PER>\ <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on tight to my hand, <PER>Ron</PER>,  grab my shoulder.”   <PER>Harry</PER> held out his left hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what <PER>Hermione</PER>  was waiting for.
<PER>Hermione</PER>  twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing  house rang in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears as she dragged him once  more into darkness.
“Protego Totalum ... Salvio Hexia ...”   “That treacherous old bleeder!” <PER>Ron</PER> panted, emerging  from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a        glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER> before we left, so they knew  Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!”     “Why hide me, though?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, you are, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” agreed <PER>Harry</PER> fervently.
“The Chamber of  Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?”         “But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, <PER>Ron</PER>!”     “You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s Invisibility Cloak — ”   “ The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly.
Then, as she glanced at  <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that it was fear: He had scared  her with his talk of living with dead people.
They could  still have descendants, though, they’d just be called  something different.”   And then it came to <PER>Harry</PER> in one shining piece, the  memory that had stirred at the sound of the name  “Peverell”: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring  in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud,  “Marvolo Gaunt!”   “Sorry?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
Marvolo Gaunt said he  was descended from the Peverells!”         <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked bewildered.
I only ever saw it really close  up after it had been cracked open.”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s comprehension in the sudden  widening of her eyes.
He’d have loved to think the  scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because  as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made  you practically royal.”   “Yes ... and that’s all very interesting,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  cautiously, “but <PER>Harry</PER>, if you’re thinking what I think  you’re think — ”         “Well, why not?
Gaunt said he was descended from  the Peverells!”   “A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on  the stone properly!”   “Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> do with it after he  broke it open?”   But <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?”   But he scarcely heard <PER>Hermione</PER>: He had pulled out  his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his  fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> again, but he was busy  undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers  shaking hard.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had the Cloak,  <PER>Hermione</PER>!
“That’s what he’s after.”         The change in his voice made <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> look  even more scared.
<PER>Harry</PER>  walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as he looked out into the night,  thinking.
It was a shock to see  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> standing exactly where he had left  them, <PER>Hermione</PER> still holding Lily’s letter, <PER>Ron</PER> at her  side looking slightly anxious.
“ — and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he  doesn’t realize ... he just thinks it’s a powerful wand     “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, moving across to him and  handing him back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think  you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.”   “But don’t you see?
Please,” she said as he  started to speak, “please just answer me this: If the  Deathly Hallows really existed, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew  about them, knew that the person who possessed all  three of them would be master of Death — <PER>Harry</PER>, why  wouldn’t he have told you?
Maybe ... maybe we should  forget about this Hallows business.”   “Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>  wished his scar would burn and show him  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, because for the first time ever,  he and <PER>Voldemort</PER> were united in wanting the very  same thing.
It was as though a flame had been  lit inside him that nothing, not <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s flat  disbelief nor <PER>Ron</PER>’s persistent doubts, could  extinguish.
He blamed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>: Their determined  indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for  dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his  certainty, which remained absolute.
“Obsession?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low fierce voice,  when <PER>Harry</PER> was careless enough to use the word one  evening, after <PER>Hermione</PER> had told him off for his lack  of interest in locating more Horcruxes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left the sign of the Hallows for  <PER>Hermione</PER> to decipher, and he had also, <PER>Harry</PER>  remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone  hidden in the golden Snitch.
... master of Death ... Why didn’t <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> understand?
“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to  be fighting?” <PER>Hermione</PER> retorted, and <PER>Harry</PER> gave up  on her.
He was  worried that the connection between himself and  <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been damaged, a connection that he  both feared and, whatever he had told <PER>Hermione</PER>,  prized.
Somehow <PER>Harry</PER> connected these unsatisfying,  vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it  was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no  longer see into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind as well as before.
As the weeks crept on, <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but  notice, even through his new self-absorption, that  <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be taking charge.
Perhaps because he  was determined to make up for having walked out on  them, perhaps because <PER>Harry</PER>’s descent into  listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership  qualities, <PER>Ron</PER> was the one now encouraging and  exhorting the other two into action.
The orphanage ...”   Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and  Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom  Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered,  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raked over them again, <PER>Harry</PER>  joining in only to stop <PER>Hermione</PER> pestering him.
He  would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying  to read <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, to find out more about  the Elder Wand, but <PER>Ron</PER> insisted on journeying to  ever more unlikely places simply, <PER>Harry</PER> was aware, to  keep them moving.
<PER>Harry</PER>  was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty,  staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had  forced their way through the chilly ground, when <PER>Ron</PER>  shouted excitedly from inside the tent.
Get in  here, <PER>Harry</PER>!”   Roused for the first time in days from his  contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried  back inside the tent to find <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  kneeling on the floor beside the little radio.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> gazed at one another in horror.
“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a  minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk  Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the  unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered  by the Death Eaters.”   Silence fell, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not  speak.
’ ”   “Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; <PER>Ron</PER>  started to speak, but <PER>Hermione</PER> forestalled him in a  whisper.
“And I’d tell him to follow his  instincts, which are good and nearly always right.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, whose eyes were full of  tears.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that  Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>” — all three of them gasped, and so  nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-known  gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly  escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where  he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’  party in his house.
“May I just add that while we here at  Potterwatch applaud <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s spirit, we would urge  even the most devoted of <PER>Harry</PER>’s supporters against  following <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s lead.
‘Support <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’ parties  are unwise in the present climate.”   “Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest  that you continue to show your devotion to the man  with the lightning scar by listening to PotterwatcM  And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard  who is proving just as elusive as <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
We like  to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to  give his views on some of the more insane rumors  circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new  correspondent: Rodent.”   “ ‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and <PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> cried out together:   “Fred!”   “No — is it George?”   “It’s Fred, I think,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, leaning in closer, as  whichever twin it was said,   “I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to  be ‘Rapier’!”   “Oh, all right then.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  were still beaming.
Hearing familiar, friendly voices  was an extraordinary tonic; <PER>Harry</PER> had become so  used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that  other people were resisting <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew  it!”     “<PER>Harry</PER> — ”   “Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, why are you so determined not  to admit it?
“I told you,  <PER>Harry</PER>, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got       to put the protection back around us — quickly — it’s  how they find — ”   But <PER>Ron</PER> stopped talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why.
His eyes had  been reduced to slits through which he could barely  see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the  tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of  four or five people wrestling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  outside too.
There was the  unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: <PER>Ron</PER>  grunted in pain and <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, “No!
“I said,” repeated Greyback, and <PER>Harry</PER> received a  blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in  pain, “what happened to you?”   “Stung,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Vernon <PER>Dudley</PER>.”   “Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and <PER>Harry</PER>  heard him move sideways to look down at <PER>Ron</PER>,  instead.
“I’b Bardy,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that his  mouth was full of blood.
“Anyone still got a wand?”   “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> from either side of him.
I said the name, I’m sorry — ”       “<PER>Harry</PER>?”     It was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from  directly behind <PER>Harry</PER>, from the person tied to  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s left.
“I think  there is a <PER>Dudley</PER> in there.”   <PER>Harry</PER> could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck,  get them safely out of this?
With a huge effort of will <PER>Harry</PER> closed his mind to  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where  he sat, tied to <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Dean, and Griphook in  the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior.
“ ‘’ermione Granger,’ ” Scabior was saying, “ ‘the  Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry  Potter.’ ”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a  supreme effort to keep himself present, not to slip  into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar  was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his  strength against the pull of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts: It  had never been so important to remain in his own  right mind.
Nobody spoke: <PER>Harry</PER> sensed the gang of  Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s arm  trembling against his.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still fighting to remain  present inside his own splitting head, could think of  nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking  across the surface of his mind —   — He was gliding around the high walls of the black  fortress —   No, he was <PER>Harry</PER>, tied up and wandless, in grave  danger —   — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest  tower —   He was <PER>Harry</PER>, and they were discussing his fate in  low voices —   — Time to fly ...   “...to the Ministry?”       “To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback.
We’ll take the boy  there.”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought he knew why Greyback was not calling  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could  hear <PER>Hermione</PER>’s breathing, fast and terrified.
I’ll do Potter!” said  Greyback, seizing a fistful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair; <PER>Harry</PER> could  feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand,  but it was hopeless: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could  not separate from the group, and as the breath was  squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully  still —   — as he forced himself through the slit of a window  like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the  cell-like room —   The prisoners lurched into one another as they  landed in a country lane.
How long it would take         <PER>Voldemort</PER> to get to this place, once he knew that  <PER>Harry</PER> was here, was another matter.
Closing his puffy  eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him  for a moment, wanting to know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was  doing, whether he knew yet that <PER>Harry</PER> was caught.
I never had it.”       “ You lie]”     As <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s anger throbbed inside him, <PER>Harry</PER>’s  scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched  his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain  present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel.
“We’re here to see <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER>!”  rasped Greyback.
We’ve caught  <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”   Greyback seized <PER>Harry</PER> and dragged him around to  face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle  around too.
’Ere, ma’am — ”   Through his puffy eyelids <PER>Harry</PER> saw Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER>  scrutinizing his swollen face.
If that is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, he will know.”   The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside;  even with his eyes almost closed <PER>Harry</PER> could make  out the wide proportions of the room.
“What is this?”   The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius  <PER>Malfoy</PER> fell on <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, come here.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare look directly at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but saw  him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was,  rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed  blur beneath white-blond hair.
“Well, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Is it <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   “I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
He was keeping  his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of  looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> was of looking at him.
Come closer!”   <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> so excited.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the  Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv — ”   “Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him,  I hope, Mr. <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said Greyback menacingly.
He approached <PER>Harry</PER> himself, came so  close that <PER>Harry</PER> could see the usually languid, pale  face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes.
What do you think?”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face up close now, right beside his  father’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers  forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that  the light fell on <PER>Hermione</PER> instead.
I saw her picture in the  Prophett Look, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, isn’t it the Granger girl?”   “I ... maybe ... yeah.”   “But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius,  striding around the bound prisoners to face <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It’s  them, Potter’s friends — <PER>Malfoy</PER>, look at him, isn’t it  Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name — ?”       “Yeah,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> again, his back to the prisoners.
What’s happened, Cissy?”   Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the  prisoners, and stopped on <PER>Harry</PER>’s right, staring at  <PER>Hermione</PER> through her heavily lidded eyes.
“I’d say I’ll get a bite or two,  wouldn’t you, ginger?”   <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Ron</PER> shaking.
“HERMIONE!” <PER>Ron</PER> bellowed, and he started to writhe  and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so  that <PER>Harry</PER> staggered.
... Just a moment ...”   <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed again from overhead, and they  could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her words  were inaudible, for <PER>Ron</PER> shouted again, “HERMIONE!
Where?”   “We found it — we found it — PLEASE!” <PER>Hermione</PER>  screamed again; <PER>Ron</PER> struggled harder than ever, and  the rusty nail slipped onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist.
Tell  me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with  this knife!”   “There!”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his  wrists, to see <PER>Ron</PER> running around the cellar, looking  up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor.
Mr. Ollivander has been here for  a long time, he’s tried everything.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming again: The sound went  through <PER>Harry</PER> like physical pain.
CRUCIO\”   <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs,   <PER>Ron</PER> was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with  his fists, and <PER>Harry</PER> in utter desperation seized  <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s pouch from around his neck and groped  inside it: He pulled out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Snitch and      shook it, hoping for he did not know what — nothing  happened — he waved the broken halves of the  phoenix wand, but they were lifeless — the mirror  fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a  gleam of brightest blue —   <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.
He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and  saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling  of their prison, and upstairs <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming  worse than ever, and next to him <PER>Ron</PER> was bellowing,  “HERMIONE!
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the  sword is real or not!”   <PER>Harry</PER> dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was  huddled on the floor.
“DOB — !”     <PER>Harry</PER> hit <PER>Ron</PER> on the arm to stop him shouting, and  <PER>Ron</PER> looked terrified at his mistake.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a  voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.”       “But how did you — ?”     An awful scream drowned <PER>Harry</PER>’s words: <PER>Hermione</PER>  was being tortured again.
...”   He felt <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s fury, but as <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed  again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the  horror of his own present.
What was that noise  in the cellar?”   <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at each other.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> launched themselves upon him.
<PER>Ron</PER> seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced it  upward; <PER>Harry</PER> slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling  his voice.
“No!”   <PER>Ron</PER> had released Wormtail too, and together he and  <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from  around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use.
“Relashiol” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pointing the wand at the silver  hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his  knees, and at the same moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a  dreadful scream from overhead.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other, then leaving  Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the  stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading  to the drawing room.
That wand will never, ever be  yours — ”   And <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s fury broke: A burst of green light  filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted  from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and  <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to the window, his wrath barely  controllable.
Greyback, take her if you want her.”       “NOOOOOOOOOOOO!”     <PER>Ron</PER> had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked  around, shocked; she turned her wand to face <PER>Ron</PER>  instead —   “ ExpelliarmusV’ he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand  at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught  by <PER>Harry</PER>, who had sprinted after <PER>Ron</PER>.
Lucius,  Narcissa, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and Greyback wheeled about; <PER>Harry</PER>  yelled, “Stupefy\” and Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> collapsed onto  the hearth.
Jets of light flew from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s, Narcissa’s,  and Greyback’s wands; <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself to the  floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.
Bellatrix was supporting <PER>Hermione</PER>, who seemed to be  unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife  to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s throat.
“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade  into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s throat: <PER>Harry</PER> saw beads of blood  appear there.
Your death approaches!”       <PER>Harry</PER> knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of  it, and he could feel <PER>Voldemort</PER> flying through the sky  from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon  he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and  <PER>Harry</PER> could see no way out.
As <PER>Ron</PER> ran to pull <PER>Hermione</PER> out of the wreckage,  <PER>Harry</PER> took his chance: He leapt over an armchair and  wrested the three wands from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s grip, pointed all  of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefyl” The  werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew  up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground.
“Dobby is a  free elf, and Dobby has come to save <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and  his friends!”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar was blinding him with pain.
As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of  the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of  Narcissa and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, of the streak of red that was  <PER>Ron</PER>’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s  knife flew across the room at the place where he was  vanishing —   Bill and Fleur’s .
THE WANDMAKER   It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an  instant <PER>Harry</PER> knelt again beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body  at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in  reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the  grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife.
As  he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his  scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his  mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long  telescope, he saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> punishing those they  had left behind at <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor.
His rage was  dreadful and yet <PER>Harry</PER>’s grief for Dobby seemed to  diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that  reached <PER>Harry</PER> from across a vast, silent ocean.
He had learned control at  last, learned to shut his mind to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the very  thing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had wanted him to learn from  <PER>Snape</PER>.
Just as <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been able to  possess <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was consumed with grief  for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate <PER>Harry</PER>  now, while he mourned Dobby.
Grief, it seemed, drove  <PER>Voldemort</PER> out ... though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, of course,  would have said that it was love.
Deeper and deeper <PER>Harry</PER> sank into the grave, and he  knew where <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been tonight, and whom  he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and  why.
“How’s <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Better,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown,  pale and unsteady on her feet; <PER>Ron</PER> put an arm  around her when she reached him.
He forced himself not to break down as he  remembered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral, and the rows and  rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in  the front row, the recitation of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  achievements, the stateliness of the white marble  tomb.
The Death Eaters  know <PER>Ron</PER>’s with you now, they’re bound to target the  family — don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of  <PER>Harry</PER>’s expression.
The  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head smiled, surveying <PER>Harry</PER>  over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in  prayer.
“You  turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-  conscious goblin, <PER>Hermione</PER> looks as though she’s  been tortured, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s just refused to tell me  anything — ”   “We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“I need you two as well!” he called to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had been skulking, half concealed, in  the doorway of the sitting room.
“How are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You were  amazing — coming up with that story when she was  hurting you like that — ”   <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a weak smile as <PER>Ron</PER> gave her a one-  armed squeeze.
Come on.”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed Bill up the steep  stairs onto a small landing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took the  chair beside the dressing table; <PER>Ron</PER> sat on the arm.
“You are an unusual wizard, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.”   “In what way?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing his scar  absently.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger  he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but  you are a very odd wizard.”   “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though he had gone mad.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but she was cut off by  Griphook.
“It belongs to the Lestranges.”   He saw <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> look at each other,  astonished, but there would be time enough to  explain after Griphook had given his answer.
Can you believe that?”   The goblin looked slantwise at <PER>Harry</PER>, and the  lightning scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead prickled, but he  ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its  invitation.
Not from wand-  carriers.”   “Wand-carriers,” repeated <PER>Harry</PER>: The phrase fell oddly  upon his ears as his scar prickled, as <PER>Voldemort</PER>  turned his thoughts northward, and as <PER>Harry</PER> burned  to question Ollivander next door.
“Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to  be freed for years?” (<PER>Ron</PER> fidgeted uncomfortably on  the arm of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s chair.)
“You can’t want You-  Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!”   The goblin gazed at <PER>Hermione</PER> with the same curiosity  he had shown <PER>Harry</PER>.
We have a duty to the objects placed in our  care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.”   The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes  roved from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> and then back  again.
“But — ” <PER>Ron</PER> started angrily; <PER>Hermione</PER> nudged him in  the ribs.
“He’s enjoying keeping us  hanging.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling them both away  from the door, into the middle of the still-dark  landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying?
He would  have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first  time he ever went to Diagon Alley.”   <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to understand about Gringotts  before they spoke to Ollivander.
The safest place in the world for anything you  want to hide, <PER>Hagrid</PER> told me ... except for Hogwarts.”   When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished speaking, <PER>Ron</PER> shook his  head.
Come on — Ollivander now.”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked bewildered but impressed  as they followed him across the little landing and  knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on  the empty bed, beside <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered  wand had vanished, and did not look away until  <PER>Harry</PER> had taken from his pocket the two wands he  had brought from the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’.
This was the wand of <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”     “Was?” repeated <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I took this wand from <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> by force,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
No, I should not say that it is necessary  to kill.”   “There are legends, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and as his  heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became  more intense; he was sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  decided to put his idea into action.
“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked  appealingly at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for help.
“He wanted to  know everything I could tell him about the wand  variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of  Destiny, or the Elder Wand.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He can’t  know that, <PER>Harry</PER>, how could he — ?”   “Priori Incantatem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We left your wand  and the blackthorn wand at the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’, <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a  reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about  that now — ”   But Mr. Ollivander intervened.
Thank you for telling me all of this.”   He led <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> down the staircase.
They all looked up at <PER>Harry</PER> as he appeared  in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and  continued into the garden, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> behind  him.
He must make only one more short  effort, so that he could explain to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
How Grindelwald found out  that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if  Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor,  it can’t have been that difficult.”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at the gates of Hogwarts; <PER>Harry</PER> could  see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing  in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer.
And at the height of his power, when  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew he was the only one who could  stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and  he took the Elder Wand.”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had the Elder Wand?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s go  and get it before he does!”   “It’s too late for that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He’s there now.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said furiously.
He wanted me  to get the Horcruxes.”   “The unbeatable wand, <PER>Harry</PER>!” moaned <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly,  waiting for <PER>Snape</PER> ’s figure to disappear.
The enormity of his decision not to race <PER>Voldemort</PER> to  the wand still scared <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted us to work out the  symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out  what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the  Hallows?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, if that really is the Elder Wand,  how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-   P a g e | 568 <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling     Who?” <PER>Harry</PER> had no answers: There were moments  when he wondered whether it had been outright  madness not to try to prevent <PER>Voldemort</PER> breaking  open the tomb.
The odd thing was that <PER>Hermione</PER>’s support made him  feel just as confused as <PER>Ron</PER>’s doubts.
“You couldn’t have broken into  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s grave.”   But the idea of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s corpse frightened <PER>Harry</PER>  much less than the possibility that he might have  misunderstood the living <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s intentions.
From time to time,  anger at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> crashed over him again,  powerful as the waves slamming themselves against  the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  had not explained before he died.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been staring out  over the wall that separated the cottage garden from  the cliff when <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had found him; he  wished they had not, having no wish to join in with  their argument.
“Yes, he is, <PER>Ron</PER>, please don’t start that again!”   “Look at the facts, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, speaking  across <PER>Harry</PER>, who continued to gaze at the horizon.
The eye <PER>Harry</PER> saw in the  mirror — ”   “<PER>Harry</PER> admits he could have imagined the eye!
Don’t  you, <PER>Harry</PER>?”   “I could have,” said <PER>Harry</PER> without looking at her.
“There you go!” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER>  could carry on.
“If it wasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, explain how  Dobby knew we were in the cellar, <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “I can’t — but can you explain how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sent  him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?”   “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He would have gone  on.”   “What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, but before  <PER>Harry</PER> could say any more, a voice behind them said, “  ’Arry?”   Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair  flying in the breeze.
We  can’t let him have that sword.”   “It is true?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he  hasn’t asked for one of our wands.”   “Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards,   <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned back to face him,  “how’s this?
We switch them,  and give him the fake.”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, he’d know the difference better than we would!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
And you wonder why  goblins don’t like wizards, <PER>Ron</PER>?”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears had turned red.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we can’t — ”   “He can have it,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “after we’ve used it  on all of the Horcruxes.
“I have your word, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, that you will give me  the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?”   “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly  fail to notice that something was going on now that  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> only emerged for  mealtimes.
Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at  the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and Dean can take zat room.”   “We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of  having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy  was essential to their plans.
“Don’t worry about us.”  And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off  your hands soon too, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I.
...”   Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at <PER>Harry</PER> as  he passed, following Luna into the combined dining  and sitting room where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were  laying the dinner table.
“Well, more of  a crown, really.”   <PER>Ron</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and grinned; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that  he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they  had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.
Fleur came running out of the  kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet,  his wand pointing at the door; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> did the same.
All  around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief:  <PER>Hermione</PER> and Fleur both squealed,   “Congratulations!” and <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Blimey, a baby!” as  if he had never heard of such a thing before.
“M-me?” stammered <PER>Harry</PER>   “You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one  better — ”   “I — yeah — blimey — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now  Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was  persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re planning something with Griphook.”   It was a statement, not a question, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not  bother to deny it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what do you want from Griphook, and what  have you promised him in return?”   “I can’t tell you that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
GRINGOTTS   Their plans were made, their preparations complete;  in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black  hair (plucked from the sweater <PER>Hermione</PER> had been  wearing at <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor) lay curled in a small glass  phial on the mantelpiece.
“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  nodding toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll  be pretty convincing.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened that the wand might sting  or bite her as she picked it up.
... It’s like a bit of her.”   <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but remember how <PER>Hermione</PER>  had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand,  insisting that he was imagining things when it did not  work as well as his own, telling him to simply  practice.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the hawthorn wand that had  once belonged to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the  secret workings of wands, <PER>Harry</PER> thought he knew  what <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s problem was: She had not won the  walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from  Bellatrix.
It was now packed inside the beaded  bag, which, <PER>Harry</PER> was impressed to learn, <PER>Hermione</PER>  had protected from the Snatchers by the simple  expedient of stuffing it down her sock.
It had been impossible to decide how they  were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone together for more  than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother  lessons,” growled <PER>Ron</PER>, as the goblin’s long fingers  kept appearing around the edges of doors.
<PER>Hermione</PER> disapproved so heartily of the  planned double-cross that <PER>Harry</PER> had given up      attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it;  <PER>Ron</PER>, on the rare occasions that they had been able to  snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up  with nothing better than “Well just have to wing it,  mate.”   <PER>Harry</PER> slept badly that night.
Once or twice he heard <PER>Ron</PER> stir and was  sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing  the sitting room with Dean, so <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak.
Though <PER>Harry</PER>  knew perfectly well that it was really <PER>Hermione</PER>, he  could not suppress a shiver of loathing.
But I  liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you  did last time.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed and set to work, muttering under  her breath as she transformed various aspects of  <PER>Ron</PER>’s appearance.
“There,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how does he look, <PER>Harry</PER>?”       It was just possible to discern <PER>Ron</PER> under his disguise,  but only, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, because he knew him so  well.
“I should climb up now, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, I think?”   <PER>Harry</PER> bent down and the goblin clambered onto his  back, his hands linked in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat.
“Good morning,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> crept  past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the  Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s ear as  they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard.
“Why, Madam Lestrange!”         <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around and Griphook tightened his  hold around <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a  crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was  striding toward them.
“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, but  at that moment <PER>Harry</PER> could not think who Travers  was.
“ He’s another Death Eater\” breathed Griphook, and  <PER>Harry</PER> sidled sideways to repeat the information into  <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s ear.
“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants  of <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor were confined to the house, after the  ... ah ... escape.”         <PER>Harry</PER> willed <PER>Hermione</PER> to keep her head.
I do not recognize him.”         “This is Dragomir Despard,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>; they had  decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover  for <PER>Ron</PER> to assume.
<PER>Ron</PER> sloped  along beside them, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook followed.
A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they  needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers  marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side,  there was no means for <PER>Harry</PER> to communicate with       <PER>Hermione</PER> or <PER>Ron</PER>.
Knowing that he had only seconds; <PER>Harry</PER>  pointed <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand at each of the guards in turn  and murmured, “Confundo” twice.
He stared down at the thin golden Probe  and then at his companion, who said in a slightly  dazed voice,   “Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> swept forward, <PER>Ron</PER> by her side, <PER>Harry</PER> and  Griphook trotting invisibly behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up  at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came  to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he  had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his  life, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> standing beside him saying, “ Like I  said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had  seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted  repository of a trove of gold he had never known he  possessed, and never for an instant could he have  dreamed that he would return to steal.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Travers headed toward an old  goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through  an eyeglass.
<PER>Hermione</PER> allowed Travers to step ahead  of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall  to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in <PER>Harry</PER>’s  ear, “the Imperius Cursel”   <PER>Harry</PER> raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak,  pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the  first time in his life, “Imperiol”   A curious sensation shot down <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, a feeling  of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind,  down the sinews and veins connecting him to the  wand and the curse it had just cast.
I always think wands require a little  breaking in, don’t you?”   <PER>Hermione</PER> looked utterly bewildered, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s  enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of  events without comment.
“They’re Imperiused,” he added,  in response to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s confused queries  about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now  standing there looking blank.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure he could hear shouting  behind them in the main hall as they all clambered  into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> crammed together in the back.
They might as well have left enormous footprints  behind them; the more he thought about it, the more  foolish it seemed to have disguised <PER>Hermione</PER> as         Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand,  when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it —   They were deeper than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever penetrated  within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed  and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a  waterfall pounding over the track.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the cart smash into  pieces against the passage wall, heard <PER>Hermione</PER>  shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward  the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly  on the rocky passage floor.
“C-Cushioning Charm,” <PER>Hermione</PER> spluttered, as <PER>Ron</PER>  pulled her to her feet, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror he saw  that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood  there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely  herself; <PER>Ron</PER> was red-haired and beardless again.
They know there are impostors in  Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> checking that she still had the  beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under  his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility  Cloak.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think I can hear people coming!” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the  waterfall and cried, “Protego\” They saw the Shield  Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up  the passageway.
“Griphook, how much farther?”   “Not far, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, not far ...”   And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which  <PER>Harry</PER> had been prepared, but which still brought all  of them to a halt.
“You know what to do,” Griphook told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He had described Hufflepuff’s cup to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux  that resided in this vault, he did not know what it  looked like.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had lit their wands too,  and were now examining the piles of objects  surrounding them.
Aargh!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed in pain, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned his  wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling  from her grip.
“Everything you touch will burn and  multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you  continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually  be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!”   “Okay, don’t touch anything!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately,  but even as he said it, <PER>Ron</PER> accidentally nudged one of  the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more  exploded into being while <PER>Ron</PER> hopped on the spot,  part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot  metal.
“Stand still, don’t move!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching at  <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It’s there, it’s up there\”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> pointed their wands at it too, so  that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way  spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga  Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of  Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by  Tom Riddle.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, give it here!”   <PER>Hermione</PER> fumbled inside her robes, drew out the  beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then  removed the shining sword.
<PER>Harry</PER>  looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and saw terror in their  faces.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the clanking grew louder,  “I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it — ”   She raised her wand, pointed it at <PER>Harry</PER>, and  whispered, “Levicorpus.”   Hoisted into the air by his ankle, <PER>Harry</PER> hit a suit of  armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot  bodies, filling the cramped space.
With screams of  pain <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the two goblins were  knocked aside into other objects, which also began to  replicate.
“Impervius\” screeched <PER>Hermione</PER> in an attempt to  protect herself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the goblins from the burning  metal.
Then the worst scream yet made <PER>Harry</PER> look down:   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waist-deep in treasure,  struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the  rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and  nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in  view.
“Liberacorpus\” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, and with a crash he and  Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling  treasure, and the sword flew out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
One hand holding tightly to a fistful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair, to  make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of  burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword  and swung it high out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s reach.
The goblin still  astride him, <PER>Harry</PER> dived and caught it, and although  he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish  it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from  his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the  vault opened up again and he found himself sliding  uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery  gold and silver that bore him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> into  the outer chamber.
“Stupefyl” he bellowed, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined  in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and  some toppled over, but others advanced, and <PER>Harry</PER>  saw several wizard guards running around the  corner.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — what are you doing?” cried  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He stretched  out an arm; <PER>Hermione</PER> hoisted herself up; <PER>Ron</PER>      climbed on behind them, and a second later the  dragon became aware that it was untethered.
<PER>Harry</PER>,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, flat on its back, scraped against  the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening,  while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that  glanced off its flanks.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes were  shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the  crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only  cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any  moment; then he heard <PER>Hermione</PER> yelling, “Defodiol”   She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway,  carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward  the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking  goblins: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> copied her, blasting the  ceiling apart with more gouging spells.
Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and  finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings:  Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it  could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> still clinging to its back, it  forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them  buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it  staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into  the sky.
Behind him, whether from  delight or fear he could not tell, <PER>Ron</PER> kept swearing at  the top of his voice, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be  sobbing.
“Is it my imagination,” shouted <PER>Ron</PER> after a  considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing  height?”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw deep green mountains  and lakes, coppery in the sunset.
“Straight into the water before it  realizes we’re here!”   They agreed, <PER>Hermione</PER> a little faintly, and now <PER>Harry</PER>  could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling  in the surface of the water.
He kicked toward  the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous  ripples emanating in circles from the places where  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had fallen.
As <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of  the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard,  and landed at last on a distant bank.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> struck out for the opposite  shore.
<PER>Hermione</PER> handed <PER>Harry</PER> the bottle, then pulled out  three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from  Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them.
“Will  it be all right?”   “You sound like <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Maybe they’ll cover up — ”         The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of <PER>Ron</PER>’s  voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved <PER>Harry</PER>’s head  like a sword stroke.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had always suspected him;  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, dead on his orders; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, whose  wand was his now, yet who reached out from the  ignominy of death through the boy, the boy —   But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his  Horcruxes, he, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, would have known,  would have felt it?
He, the greatest wizard of them all;  he, the most powerful; he, the killer of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  and of how many other worthless, nameless men:  How could Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> not have known, if he,  himself, most important and precious, had been  attacked, mutilated?
...  To tell <PER>Snape</PER> why the boy might return would be  foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust  Bellatrix and <PER>Malfoy</PER>: Didn’t their stupidity and  carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?
...   <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back  to the present: He was lying on the bank of the lake in  the setting sun, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were looking  down at him.
I knew it.”   “What?”   <PER>Ron</PER> was gaping at him; <PER>Hermione</PER> sat up, looking  worried.
He thinks the Hogwarts one is  safest, because <PER>Snape</PER>’s there, because it’ll be so hard  not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one  last, but he could still be there within hours — ”   “Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>,  now scrambling to his feet too.
“No, he was concentrating on warning <PER>Snape</PER>, he  didn’t think about exactly where it is — ”   “Wait, wait\” cried <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> caught up the  Horcrux and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the Invisibility Cloak  again.
He saw the achingly  familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts,  and the outline of black mountains beyond the  village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off  toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows  of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the  heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he  had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a  desperately weak <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; all this in a second,  upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip  upon <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms, it happened.
The air was rent by a scream that sounded like  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s when he had realized the cup had been  stolen: It tore at every nerve in <PER>Harry</PER>’s body, and he  knew immediately that their appearance had caused  it.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Ron</PER>’s wrist as he raised his wand; there  were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it  would give away their position.
He’s here.”   Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> backed as quickly as possible down the  nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed  them by inches.
“Disapparate  now!”   “Great idea,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could reply a  Death Eater shouted,   “We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting  away!
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, <PER>Harry</PER>!”  <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
He,  <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated down the side street,  groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a  sound.
It       was of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that he thought as he  whispered, “Expecto Patronum).”   The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The  dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell  from somewhere out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the  Cloak off himself and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten  their fill, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat slumped dozily in  their chairs.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — I mean, your  brother — wanted us — ”   The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth ’s  glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and  <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider,  Aragog.
Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at  <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> rather timidly.
“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>,  trying to spare <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cared about <PER>Harry</PER>, very  much,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice.
They forced their way through the hedge, and  when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit  carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.”   <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes were huge in the firelight; <PER>Ron</PER> looked  slightly sick.
But my mother  was killed.”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he  did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept  talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered how long it had been  since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he  had ever spoken about it.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s face was wet  with tears, and <PER>Ron</PER> was almost as pale as Aberforth.
‘Don’t hurt them, please ... hurt me instead.’ ”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He thought he was back there with you and  Grindelwald, I know he did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> whimpering, pleading.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> loved <PER>Harry</PER>,” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Why didn’t he say to him, Take care of  yourself, here’s how to survive’?”   “Because,” said <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer,  “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your  own safety!
I knew it, <PER>Harry</PER>Y’           THE LOST DIADEM   “<PER>Neville</PER> — what the — how — ?”   But <PER>Neville</PER> had spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and with  yells of delight was hugging them too.
The longer  <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Neville</PER>, the worse he appeared: One  of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were  gouge marks on his face, and his general air of  unkemptness suggested that he had been living  rough.
Thanks a lot.”   <PER>Neville</PER> held out his hand to <PER>Hermione</PER> and helped her  to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel;  <PER>Ron</PER> followed, then <PER>Neville</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was  all for keeping it as a pet — ”   “Don’t exaggerate, <PER>Ron</PER> — ”   “But what have you been doing?
I think you’ve been up to something.”   “You’re right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but tell us about  Hogwarts, <PER>Neville</PER>, we haven’t heard anything.”   “It’s been ... well, it’s not really like Hogwarts  anymore,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, the smile fading from his face  as he spoke.
We’re supposed to practice the  Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions     “What?”   <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s united voices echoed up  and down the passage.
I got this one,”  he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her  how much Muggle blood she and her brother have  got.”   “Blimey, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “there’s a time and a place  for getting a smart mouth.”   “You didn’t hear her,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
I used to  notice that when you did it, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and  <PER>Neville</PER>’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.
They don’t want to spill too much  pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy  but they won’t actually kill us.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what was worse, the things that  <PER>Neville</PER> was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which  he said them.
Old Xeno Lovegood was  getting a bit too outspoken in The Quihhler, so they  dragged Luna off the train on the way back for  Christmas.”   “<PER>Neville</PER>, she’s all right, we’ve seen her — ”   “Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.”   From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and <PER>Harry</PER>  recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army had used to send one another  messages.
“These have been great,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, beaming at  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> hated it.”   “You used to?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had noticed the past  tense.
That’s when they  decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose,  and they went for Gran.”   “They what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  together.
I don’t know  whether they were planning to kill me or send me to  Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.”   “But,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t  — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?”   “ ’Course,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> followed, he heard <PER>Neville</PER> call out to unseen  people:   “Look who it is!
Didn’t I tell you?”   As <PER>Harry</PER> emerged into the room beyond the passage,  there were several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s  Potter, it’s POTTER!” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>l”   He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of  lamps and many faces.
The next moment, he, <PER>Ron</PER>,  and <PER>Hermione</PER> were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the  back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what  seemed to be more than twenty people: They might  just have won a Quidditch final.
“Okay, okay, calm down!” <PER>Neville</PER> called, and as the  crowd backed away, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to take in their  surroundings.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s the man!”   “It’s quite straightforward, really,” said <PER>Neville</PER>  modestly.
With an enormous effort he pulled out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the  Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face  and <PER>Ron</PER> holding him up.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> was saying.
He looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  trying to tell them without words that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had  just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes.
“Well,  there’s something we — <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I — need  to do, and then we’ll get out of here.”   Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore.
“Because ...” In his desperation to start looking for  the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private  discussion with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about where they  might commence their search, <PER>Harry</PER> found it difficult  to gather his thoughts.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left the three of us a job,” he said  carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean,  he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.”   “We’re his army,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
Everyone in here’s proven they’re  loyal to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — loyal to you.”   “Look,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, without knowing what he was  going to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door  had just opened behind him.
<PER>Ginny</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a  radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully  appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never  been less pleased to see her.
“You’ve got to stop this!” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned suddenly to <PER>Harry</PER>.
We don’t have to tell them it’s  a Horcrux.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who murmured,  “I think <PER>Ron</PER>’s right.
We don’t even know what we’re  looking for, we need them.” And when <PER>Harry</PER> looked  unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone,  <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Harry</PER> thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head  threatening to split again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had warned  him against telling anyone but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  about the Horcruxes.
But  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had trusted <PER>Snape</PER>, and where had that  led?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> and his own disappointment was  mirrored back at him.
“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Wait for me here and keep, you  know — the other one — safe.”         Cho had got to her feet, but <PER>Ginny</PER> said rather  fiercely, “No, Luna will take <PER>Harry</PER>, won’t you, Luna?”   “Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho  sat down again, looking disappointed.
“How do we get out?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Neville</PER>.
Be careful, <PER>Harry</PER>, they’re  always patrolling the corridors at night.”   “No problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They’re  pleased!”   “Yeah ... great ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he  chose to sink again into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
Potter belongs in my House!”   Beneath the disbelief and anger, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a little  strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva  <PER>McGonagall</PER> gushed up inside him.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand,  and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.”         As Amycus spun around, <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “Crucio\”     The Death Eater was lifted off his feet.
“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, the blood  thundering through his brain, “you need to really  mean it.”   “Potter!” whispered Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, clutching  her heart.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on  the way.”   “Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked  Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility  Cloak.
“He already knows where I  am.”     In a distant part of <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain, that part connected  to the angry, burning scar, he could see <PER>Voldemort</PER>       sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green  boat.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> or Luna  could act, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> rose to her feet,  pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and  said, “Imperio.”   Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up  her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and handed it over along with his own.
“Potter,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning to face  him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’         predicament, “if <PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> does  indeed know that you are here — ”   As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain  blazed through <PER>Harry</PER>, setting his scar on fire, and for  a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion  had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay  safe beneath the surface —   “Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and <PER>Harry</PER>  came back: He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to  steady himself.
But we’ve got to get  the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s  me <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants, but he won’t care about killing a  few more or less, not now — ” not now he knows I’m  attacking Horcruxes, <PER>Harry</PER> finished the sentence in  his head.
The  Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral  staircase with silvery light, as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,  <PER>Harry</PER>, and Luna hurried back down.
Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the  Patronuses left them; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s tartan  dressing gown rustled over the floor, and <PER>Harry</PER> and  Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whose scar       was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the  pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but  before he could take it out, <PER>McGonagall</PER> too seemed to  become aware of their company.
Hatred boiled up in <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of him: He had  forgotten the details of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s appearance in the  magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy  black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how  his black eyes had a dead, cold look.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> into the air around her, as if he  knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
“I was under the impression,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, “that Alecto  had apprehended an intruder.”   “Really?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Because if you  have, I must insist — ”   Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> moved faster than <PER>Harry</PER> could  have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and  for a split second <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Snape</PER> must  crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield  Charm was such that <PER>McGonagall</PER> was thrown off  balance.
She brandished her wand at a torch on the  wall and it flew out of its bracket: <PER>Harry</PER>, about to  curse <PER>Snape</PER>, was forced to pull Luna out of the way  of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire  that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at <PER>Snape</PER>         Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent  that <PER>McGonagall</PER> blasted to smoke, which re-formed  and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of  pursuing daggers: <PER>Snape</PER> avoided them only by  forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with  echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another,  into its breast —   “Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind  him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, <PER>Harry</PER> saw  Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the  corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the  enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the  rear.
<PER>Snape</PER> struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it  flying back toward his attackers: <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna had  to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall  and shattered.
When <PER>Harry</PER> looked up again, <PER>Snape</PER>  was in full flight, <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout all  thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom  door and, moments later, he heard <PER>McGonagall</PER> cry,  “Coward!
<PER>Harry</PER> dragged her to her feet and they raced along  the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind  them, into the deserted classroom where Professors  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a  smashed window.
“He jumped,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and  Luna ran into the room.
“Unlike  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he was still carrying a wand ... and he  seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.”   With a tingle of horror, <PER>Harry</PER> saw in the distance a  huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness  toward the perimeter wall.
... Severus ... what ... ?”   “Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said  Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, pointing at the <PER>Snape</PER>-shaped  hole in the window.
<PER><PER>Voldemort</PER></PER> is coming,”  she told the other teachers.
“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great  Hall, Filius!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, beckoning to  <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna to follow her.
“Go and wake your students, Horace.”   <PER>Harry</PER> did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and  Luna ran after Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who had taken  up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised  her wand.
“Now, Potter,” said <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “you and Miss  Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring  them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other  Gryffindors.”   They parted at the top of the next staircase, <PER>Harry</PER>  and Luna running back toward the concealed  entrance to the Room of Requirement.
“That was Potter!”   “ <PER>Harry</PER> Potted”   “It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”   But <PER>Harry</PER> did not look back, and at last they reached  the entrance to the Room of Requirement.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on his way, they’re barricading the  school — <PER>Snape</PER>’s run for it — What are you doing  here?
“We’re fighting.”   There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of  the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as  they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order  of the Phoenix, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s old  Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading  up into the main castle.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,  you stay in this room, you hear me?”         <PER>Ginny</PER> did not seem to like the idea much, but under  her father’s unusually stern gaze, she nodded.
“Where’s <PER>Ron</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They said something about a bathroom,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>,  “not long after you left.”   “A bathroom?”   <PER>Harry</PER> strode across the room to an open door leading  off the Room of Requirement and checked the  bathroom beyond.
However, as  <PER>Harry</PER> skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table  for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Ernie Macmillan stood up at  the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we  want to stay and fight?”      There was a smattering of applause.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor  table, still looking for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Give me <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice, “and  none shall be harmed.
Then  the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same  moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs  to <PER>Harry</PER>, all of them looking toward Pansy instead,  and <PER>Harry</PER>, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands  emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and  from under sleeves.
“Where are <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “Haven’t you found — ?” began Mr. Weasley, looking  worried.
Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “oh yeah!”   He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost  forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he  could search for it: The inexplicable absence of <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER> had momentarily driven every other  thought from his mind.
Without      <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to help him he could not seem to  marshal his ideas.
He could not see <PER>Ron</PER>’s or <PER>Hermione</PER>’s names  anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of  dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement  might, he thought, be concealing them.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>  had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw  common room, and there could only be one  explanation: <PER>Voldemort</PER> feared that <PER>Harry</PER> already  knew his Horcrux was connected to that House.
My dear boy!”   Nick made to grasp <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands with both of his  own: <PER>Harry</PER>’s felt as though they had been thrust into  icy water.
“That’s her over there, <PER>Harry</PER>, the young woman with  the long hair.”   <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent,  pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight  of <PER>Harry</PER> looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and  drifted away through a solid wall.
“It’s about <PER>Voldemort</PER> — defeating  <PER>Voldemort</PER> — or aren’t you interested in that?”   She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks  became more opaque, and her voice was heated as  she replied, “Of course I — how dare you suggest — ?”   “Well, help me, then!”   Her composure was slipping.
“There’s no time to explain —  but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see  <PER>Voldemort</PER> finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you  know about the diadem!”   She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring  down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed  <PER>Harry</PER>.
... No, the diadem  had been returned secretly to its true home, and  <PER>Voldemort</PER> must have put it there —   “ — the night he asked for a job!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, finishing  his thought.
“I beg your pardon?”   “He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to let him teach!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, fighting off Fang the  boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded  figure clambered to his feet.
Yer here\”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> stooped down, bestowed upon <PER>Harry</PER> a cursory  and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered  window.
“I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good  lad!”       Beyond <PER>Hagrid</PER>, out in the dark night, <PER>Harry</PER> saw  bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird,  keening scream.
“Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” panted <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “this is it, eh?
Time  ter fight?”   “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, where have you come from?”   “Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said  <PER>Hagrid</PER> grimly.
Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ —  where’s <PER>Ron</PER> an’ <PER>Hermione</PER>?”   “That,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “is a really good question.
“Where’re we goin’?” puffed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, pounding along at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s heels, making the floorboards quake.
“I dunno exactly,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making another  random turn, “but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> must be  around here somewhere.
Of course, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in  that particular place, but he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had strayed off  the beaten track in his time at school — here at last  was a secret he and <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew, that  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never discovered —   He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was  thundering past followed by <PER>Neville</PER> and half a dozen  others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying  what appeared to be large potted plants.
“Mandrakes!” <PER>Neville</PER> bellowed at <PER>Harry</PER> over his  shoulder as he ran.
“Going to lob them over the walls  — they won’t like this!”   <PER>Harry</PER> knew now where to go: He sped off, with <PER>Hagrid</PER>  and Fang galloping behind him.
“It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but  the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of  china flew like shrapnel through the air, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>  pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving <PER>Harry</PER>  alone.
“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive  them out, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, see them off!”   <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a  small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and  Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty  plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret  passageway.
“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my  pub, Potter!”   “I know, we’re evacuating,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s     “ — attacking because they haven’t handed you over,  yeah,” said Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of  Hogsmeade heard him.
Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?”   “It wouldn’t stop <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “and your  brother would never have done it.”   Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite  direction.
... Well, it was  the truth, <PER>Harry</PER> thought as he ran on again;  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had defended <PER>Snape</PER> for so long,  would never have held students ransom.
...   And then he skidded around a final corner and with a  yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER>, both with their arms full of large, curved,       dirty yellow objects, <PER>Ron</PER> with a broomstick under his  arm.
“It was <PER>Ron</PER>, all <PER>Ron</PER>’s idea!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>  breathlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in <PER>Ron</PER>  and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he  now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk.
“Show him, <PER>Ron</PER>!”   <PER>Ron</PER> made a horrible strangled hissing noise.
It was empty  except for three women: <PER>Ginny</PER>, Tonks, and an elderly  witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom <PER>Harry</PER>  recognized immediately as <PER>Neville</PER>’s grandmother.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I’m sorry, but we need you to  leave too.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw away the fangs and broomstick he was  holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he  lifted <PER>Hermione</PER> off her feet.
“Is this the moment?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked weakly, and when  nothing happened except that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on  the spot, he raised his voice.
There’s a war going  on here!”   <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> broke apart, their arms still  around each other.
“I know, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked as though he  had recently been hit on the back of the head with a  Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?”   “Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” <PER>Harry</PER>  shouted.
“D’you think you could just — just hold it in  until we’ve got the diadem?”   “Yeah — right — sorry — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he and  <PER>Hermione</PER> set about gathering up fangs, both pink in  the face.
“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: <PER>Harry</PER>  turned and saw <PER>Ginny</PER> and Tonks, both with their  wands drawn at the next window, which was missing  several panes.
<PER>Ginny</PER> turned, helpless, to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, we’ll be back in a moment,  just keep out of the way, keep safe — come on!” he  said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and they ran back to the  stretch of wall beyond which the Room of  Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next  entrant.
...”   He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet  <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had mended last year with such  disastrous consequences, then hesitated, looking up  and down aisles of junk; he could not remember  where to go next.
Through the  small space between their leering faces he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
He could not hear <PER>Ron</PER>  or <PER>Hermione</PER> anymore.
“So how come you three aren’t with <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”  asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
What’s a die-dum?”   “<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice echoed suddenly from the other  side of the wall to <PER>Harry</PER>’s right.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, as somewhere out of sight  <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard innumerable  objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the  destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart,  cried, “Finite!” and it steadied.
“It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares  about a die-dum?”   “Potter came in here to get it,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> with ill-  disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his  colleagues, “so that must mean — ”   “ ‘Must mean?” Crabbe turned on <PER>Malfoy</PER> with  undisguised ferocity.
You an’ your  dad are finished.”   “<PER>Harry</PER>?” shouted <PER>Ron</PER> again, from the other side of  the junk wall.
“But if I can, I  will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s  thediff— ?”   A jet of scarlet light shot past <PER>Harry</PER> by inches:  <PER>Hermione</PER> had run around the corner behind him and  sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe ’s head.
Avada Kedavral”   <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> dive aside, and his fury that  Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind.
DONT KILL HIM!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> yelled at  Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at <PER>Harry</PER>:  Their split second’s hesitation was all <PER>Harry</PER> needed.
“ Expelliarmusl”   Goyle ’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared  into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt  foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; <PER>Malfoy</PER>  jumped out of range of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s second Stunning  Spell, and <PER>Ron</PER>, appearing suddenly at the end of the      aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which  narrowly missed.
The wandless <PER>Malfoy</PER> cowered behind a  three-legged wardrobe as <PER>Hermione</PER> charged toward  them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she  came.
“RUN!”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him  along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking  terrified; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pelted along in  his wake, and the fire pursued them.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view:  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead; the fiery  monsters were circling them, drawing closer and  closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat  was solid as a wall around them.
“What can we do?”   “Here!”   <PER>Harry</PER> seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from  the nearest pile of junk and threw one to <PER>Ron</PER>, who  pulled <PER>Hermione</PER> onto it behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see a  trace of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: He  swooped as low as he dared over the marauding  monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was  nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die.
...         “<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed <PER>Ron</PER>,  though it was impossible to see where the door was  through the black smoke.
“It’s — too — dangerous — !” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, but <PER>Harry</PER>  wheeled in the air.
...   And he saw them: <PER>Malfoy</PER> with his arms around the  unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a  fragile tower of charred desks, and <PER>Harry</PER> dived.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> saw him coming and raised one arm, but even  as <PER>Harry</PER> grasped it he knew at once that it was no  good: Goyle was too heavy and <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s hand, covered  in sweat, slid instantly out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s —   “IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!”  roared <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera  bore down upon them, he and <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged  Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching,  into the air once more as <PER>Malfoy</PER> clambered up behind  <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed <PER>Malfoy</PER>  in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, and <PER>Harry</PER> sped up, following <PER>Ron</PER>,  <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Goyle through the billowing black  smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them  the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames  were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed  fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a  sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara —         “ What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s  that way\” screamed <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> made a  hairpin swerve and dived.
The diadem seemed to fall  in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped  toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he  had it, caught it around his wrist —   <PER>Harry</PER> swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he  soared upward and straight toward the place where,  he prayed, the door stood open: <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and  Goyle had vanished; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was screaming and  holding <PER>Harry</PER> so tightly it hurt.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and sat up:  The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished,  and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat panting on the floor beside  Goyle, who was still unconscious.
“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they  mentioned how to stop it, really,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose  hair, like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, was singed, and whose face was  blackened.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran forward to help: Jets of  light flew in every direction and the man dueling  Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they  saw a high forehead and streaked hair —   “Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx  straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and  clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful  discomfort.
They had been grouped together,  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and Percy, the two  Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other  Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment,  when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world  was rent apart.
<PER>Harry</PER>  grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand as they staggered and  stumbled over stone and wood.
“Get down!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, as more curses flew  through the night: He and <PER>Ron</PER> had both grabbed  <PER>Hermione</PER> and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay  across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm,  and when <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got  to move!” he shook his head.
“Percy!” <PER>Harry</PER> saw tear tracks streaking the grime  coating <PER>Ron</PER>’s face as he seized his elder brother’s  shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge.
We’re going to     <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, and <PER>Harry</PER>, turning, did not need  to ask why.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> shouted together; their spells collided  and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking  horribly, and vanished into the darkness.
“Let’s move, NOW!”   Pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> ahead of him with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>  stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpits.
He could not  bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to,  and after making sure that the body was well hidden,  he took off after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, in here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed.
She had pulled <PER>Ron</PER> behind a tapestry: They seemed  to be wrestling together, and for one mad second  <PER>Harry</PER> thought that they were embracing again; then  he saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> was trying to restrain <PER>Ron</PER>, to  stop him running after Percy.
Please —  <PER>Ron</PER> — we need the snake, we’ve got to kill the snake!”  said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
But <PER>Harry</PER> knew how <PER>Ron</PER> felt: Pursuing another  Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge;  he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people  who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other  Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure,  that <PER>Ginny</PER> was not — but he could not permit that  idea to form in his mind —   “We will fight!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
We’re the only ones who can  end it!”       She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her  torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took  great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping  a tight hold on <PER>Ron</PER>, she turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Perhaps he has decided to befriend <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   “No — never,” whispered <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
...   “Go and fetch <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “<PER>Snape</PER>, m-my Lord?”   “<PER>Snape</PER>.
He’s  just sent Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> to find <PER>Snape</PER>.”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said  <PER>Hermione</PER>, outraged.
You stay here and look after <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I’ll go and  get it — ”   <PER>Harry</PER> cut across <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be  back as soon as I — ”         “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “it makes much more sense if I  take the Cloak and — ”   “Don’t even think about it,” <PER>Ron</PER> snarled at her.
Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could get farther than “<PER>Ron</PER>, I’m just  as capable — ” the tapestry at the top of the staircase  on which they stood was ripped open.
“POTTER!”   Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even  before their wands were fully raised, <PER>Hermione</PER>  shouted, “Glisseo\”   The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute  and she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> hurtled down it, unable to  control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters’  Stunning Spells flew far over their heads.
“Get back!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> flattened themselves against a door as a  herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded  by a sprinting Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
As she turned the  corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!”   “<PER>Harry</PER>, you get the Cloak on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their  wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were  weaving and darting around so much that there was a  strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if  they cast curses.
“Argh!”   A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over <PER>Ron</PER>’s head;  the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in  midair as <PER>Ron</PER> tried to shake them loose.
“LET’S GO!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and       pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters,  slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the  top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
“I’m <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’m <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’m on your side!”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> was on the upper landing, pleading with  another masked Death Eater.
<PER>Harry</PER> Stunned the  Death Eater as they passed: <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked around,  beaming, for his savior, and <PER>Ron</PER> punched him from  under the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> directed a Stunning  Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but  nearly hit <PER>Neville</PER>, who had emerged from nowhere  brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which  looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater  and began reeling him in.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sped down the marble  staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the  Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points  spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped  and staggered as they ran.
“How do we get out?” yelled <PER>Ron</PER> over all the  screaming, but before either <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could  answer they were bowled aside: <PER>Hagrid</PER> had come  thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery  pink umbrella.
“HAGRID, COME BACK!”     But he was not even halfway to <PER>Hagrid</PER> when he saw it  happen: <PER>Hagrid</PER> vanished amongst the spiders, and  with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement,  they retreated under the onslaught of spells, <PER>Hagrid</PER>  buried in their midst.
“HAGRID!”   <PER>Harry</PER> heard someone calling his own name, whether  friend or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down  the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders  were swarming away with their prey, and he could see  nothing of <PER>Hagrid</PER> at all.
“Oh my — !” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as she and <PER>Ron</PER>  caught up with <PER>Harry</PER> and gazed upward at the giant  now trying to seize people through the window above.
“DONT!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, grabbing <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand as  she raised her wand.
“RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared; the night was full of hideous  yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized  <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand and tore down the steps into the  grounds, <PER>Ron</PER> bringing up the rear.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not lost  hope of finding and saving <PER>Hagrid</PER>; he ran so fast that  they were halfway toward the forest before they were  brought up short again.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> closed in beside him as the  sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted,  deadened, because a silence only dementors could  bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred  was gone, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was surely dying or already  dead.
...   “Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice from a very  long way away.
He saw <PER>Ron</PER>’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker  feebly, and expire; he saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s otter twist in  midair and fade; and his own wand trembled in his  hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming  oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling.
And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s heads: The dementors  fell back before the creatures’ approach.
<PER>Harry</PER>  looked round: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were following him,  but the other three had vanished back into the battle.
“The Whomping Willow,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “go!”   Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it  into a small space into which he could not look now:  Thoughts of Fred and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and his terror for all the  people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle,  must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach  the snake and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, because that was, as  <PER>Hermione</PER> said, the only way to end it —   He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death  itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness  all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing  like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest  though the night was windless; through grounds that  seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran  faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was  he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that         protected the secret at its roots with whiplike,  slashing branches.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up, <PER>Hermione</PER>  so out of breath she could not speak.
... Was he leading <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> into a  trap?
But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel  and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake,       and the snake was where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, and  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at the end of this tunnel.
...     “<PER>Harry</PER>, we’re coming, just get in there!” said <PER>Ron</PER>,  pushing him forward.
Then <PER>Snape</PER> spoke, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart lurched:  <PER>Snape</PER> was inches away from where he crouched,  hidden.
Please.”   <PER>Snape</PER> strode past the gap, and <PER>Harry</PER> drew back a  little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering  whether there was any spell that might penetrate the  protection surrounding her, but he could not think of  anything.
“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?”         In the silence <PER>Harry</PER> imagined he could hear the snake  hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air?
I feel no  difference between this wand and the one I procured  from Ollivander all those years ago.”   <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s tone was musing, calm, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar  had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in  his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense  of fury building inside <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see his face: He  wondered whether <PER>Snape</PER> sensed danger, was trying  to find the right words to reassure his master.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> started to move around the room: <PER>Harry</PER>  lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking  in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury  mounted in <PER>Harry</PER>.
... Do you  know why I have called you back from the battle?”   And for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> ’s profile: His eyes  were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted  cage.
I know I can — ”   “I have told you, no!” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>  caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again,  and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of  a snake, and he felt <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s impatience in his  burning scar.
There is.”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> halted, and <PER>Harry</PER> could see him plainly  again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white  fingers, staring at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Why did both the wands I have used fail when  directed at <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?”   “I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.”   “Can’t you?”   The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through  <PER>Harry</PER>’s head: He forced his own fist into his mouth to  stop himself from crying out in pain.
He closed his  eyes, and suddenly he was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, looking into  <PER>Snape</PER>’s pale face.
I did so, but Lucius’s  wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.”   “I — I have no explanation, my Lord.”   <PER>Snape</PER> was not looking at <PER>Voldemort</PER> now.
I took it from the grave of Albus  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.”   And now <PER>Snape</PER> looked at <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s  face was like a death mask.
“My Lord — let me go to the boy — ”   “All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory,   I have sat here,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his voice barely       louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why  the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be,  refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for  its rightful owner ... and I think I have the answer.”   <PER>Snape</PER> did not speak.
It  did nothing to <PER>Snape</PER>, who for a split second seemed  to think he had been reprieved: But then <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  intention became clear.
The snake’s cage was rolling  through the air, and before <PER>Snape</PER> could do anything  more than yell, it had encased him, head and  shoulders, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> spoke in Parseltongue.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face  losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his  black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his         neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off  himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER> behind him, but he had  already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his  view.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down  upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes  found <PER>Harry</PER> as he tried to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over  him, and <PER>Snape</PER> seized the front of his robes and  pulled him close.
Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his  mouth and his ears and his eyes, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew  what it was, but did not know what to do —   A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his  shaking hands by <PER>Hermione</PER>.
When the flask was  full to the brim, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked as though there  was no blood left in him, his grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes  slackened.
The  hand holding <PER>Harry</PER> thudded to the floor, and <PER>Snape</PER>  moved no more.
THE PRINCE’S TALE   <PER>Harry</PER> remained kneeling at <PER>Snape</PER>’s side, simply  staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold  voice spoke so close to them that <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to his  feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking  that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had reentered the room.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s voice reverberated from the walls and  floor, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized that he was talking to  Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the  residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in  the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood  beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a  deathblow away.
One hour.”   Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook their heads frantically,  looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered  up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at <PER>Snape</PER>.
They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them  talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> could still hear <PER>Voldemort</PER> ringing in their  heads, as he could.
Without a word to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked  away.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> approach <PER>Ginny</PER>, whose  face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her.
<PER>Ron</PER>  joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm  around <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulders.
As <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>  moved closer to the rest of the family, <PER>Harry</PER> had a  clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and  Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently  asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran without stopping, clutching the  crystal flask of <PER>Snape</PER>’s last thoughts, and he did not  slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle  guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?”   “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> without thinking, because  it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise  the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase  behind.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced hopelessly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s deserted  frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s  chair, then turned his back on it.
The stone Pensieve  lay in the cabinet where it had always been: <PER>Harry</PER>  heaved it onto the desk and poured <PER>Snape</PER>’s memories  into the wide basin with its runic markings around  the edge.
He stood watching them as they marched through the  playground gate, and <PER>Harry</PER>, the only one left to  observe him, recognized <PER>Snape</PER> ’s bitter  disappointment, and understood that <PER>Snape</PER> had been  planning this moment for a while, and that it had all  gone wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around: He  was on platform nine and three-quarters, and <PER>Snape</PER>  stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin,  sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly  resembled him.
“Slytherin?”   One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had  shown no interest at all in Lily or <PER>Snape</PER> until that  point, looked around at the word, and <PER>Harry</PER>, whose  attention had been focused entirely on the two beside  the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like  <PER>Snape</PER>, but with that indefinable air of having been  well-cared-for, even adored, that <PER>Snape</PER> so  conspicuously lacked.
...   <PER>Harry</PER> was standing right behind <PER>Snape</PER> as they faced  the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces.
Professor  <PER>McGonagall</PER> dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head,         and barely a second after it had touched the dark red  hair, the hat cried, “ Gryffindoii”     <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Snape</PER> let out a tiny groan.
Lily took off  the hat, handed it back to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, then  hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she  went she glanced back at <PER>Snape</PER>, and there was a sad  little smile on her face.
At last, when only a dozen students  remained to be sorted, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> called  <PER>Snape</PER>.
And Severus <PER>Snape</PER> moved off to the other side of the  Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were  cheering him, to where Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a prefect badge  gleaming upon his chest, patted <PER>Snape</PER> on the back as  he sat down beside him.
I don’t understand how you can be  friends with them.”   <PER>Harry</PER> doubted that <PER>Snape</PER> had even heard her  strictures on Mulciber and Avery.
...   <PER>Harry</PER> watched again as <PER>Snape</PER> left the Great Hall after  sitting his O.W.L.
...  His fear infected <PER>Harry</PER> too, even though he knew that  he could not be harmed, and he looked over his  shoulder, wondering what it was that <PER>Snape</PER> was  waiting for —   Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through  the air: <PER>Harry</PER> thought of lightning, but <PER>Snape</PER> had  dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of  his hand.
What message does Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>  have for me?”   “No — no message — I’m here on my own account!”   <PER>Snape</PER> was wringing his hands: He looked a little  mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him.
“How much did you relay  to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”   “Everything — everything I heard!” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
He thinks it means her son,  he is going to hunt her down — kill them all — ”   “If she means so much to you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  “surely Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> will spare her?
Could you not  ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the  son?”   “I have — I have asked him — ”   “You disgust me,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> had  never heard so much contempt in his voice.
They can  die, as long as you have what you want?”   <PER>Snape</PER> said nothing, but merely looked up at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Please.”   “And what will you give me in return, Severus?”   “In — in return?” <PER>Snape</PER> gaped at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and  <PER>Harry</PER> expected him to protest, but after a long  moment he said, “Anything.”   The hilltop faded, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s  office, and something was making a terrible sound,  like a wounded animal.
<PER>Snape</PER> was slumped forward  in a chair and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing over him,  looking grim.
Weren’t  you hoping that Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> would spare her?”   <PER>Snape</PER>’s breathing was shallow.
“If you loved Lily Evans, if you  truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.”   <PER>Snape</PER> seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s words appeared to take a long time to  reach him.
The Dark Lord has gone     “The Dark Lord will return, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter will be in  terrible danger when he does.”       There was a long pause, and slowly <PER>Snape</PER> regained  control of himself, mastered his own breathing.
I want your  word!”   “My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best  of you?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed, looking down into  <PER>Snape</PER>’s ferocious, anguished face.
<PER>Snape</PER>  was pacing up and down in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Personally, I find him an engaging child.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned a page, and said, without looking  up, “Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?”   A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and  <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood a little apart in the  entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule  Ball passed them on their way to bed.
He is  panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much  help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.”  <PER>Snape</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s crooked-     P a g e | 769 <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling      nosed profile.
<PER>Snape</PER> was  muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the  wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a  goblet full of thick golden potion down <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s  throat.
His plan to have the poor <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy murder me.”   <PER>Snape</PER> sat down in the chair <PER>Harry</PER> had so often  occupied, across the desk from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>  could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject  of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s cursed hand, but the other held it up  in polite refusal to discuss the matter further.
Scowling, <PER>Snape</PER> said, “The Dark Lord does not expect  <PER>Malfoy</PER> to succeed.
Slow torture for <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s  parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.”   “In short, the boy has had a death sentence  pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”   “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> foresees a moment in the near future  when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?”   “He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”   “And if it does fall into his grasp,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that  you will do all in your power to protect the students of  Hogwarts?”   <PER>Snape</PER> gave a stiff nod.
Ultimately, of course, there is only  one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wrath.”   <PER>Snape</PER> raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic  as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?”   “Certainly not.
Given what has happened tonight,” he indicated his  withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen  within a year.”   “If you don’t mind dying,” said <PER>Snape</PER> roughly, “why  not let <PER>Malfoy</PER> do it?”         “That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to  play with her food before she eats it.”   His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced <PER>Snape</PER> as  they had frequently pierced <PER>Harry</PER>, as though the soul  they discussed was visible to him.
“Thank you, Severus ...”   The office disappeared, and now <PER>Snape</PER> and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were strolling together in the deserted  castle grounds by twilight.
I spend time with <PER>Harry</PER>  because I have things to discuss with him,  information I must give him before it is too late.”   “Information,” repeated <PER>Snape</PER>.
To give <PER>Voldemort</PER> what  appears to be valuable information while withholding  the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but  you.”   “Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable  of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who  has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!”   “<PER>Voldemort</PER> fears that connection,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Not in that way.”         “I don’t understand.”     “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear  close contact with a soul like <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
We were talking of minds!”   “In the case of <PER>Harry</PER> and Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, to speak of  one is to speak of the other.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> glanced around to make sure that they  were alone.
...”   They were back in <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s office, the windows  dark, and Fawkes sat silent as <PER>Snape</PER> sat quite still,  as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked around him, talking.
“<PER>Harry</PER> must not know, not until the last moment, not  until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the  strength to do what must be done?”   “But what must he do?”   “That is between <PER>Harry</PER> and me.
There will come a time  when Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> will seem to fear for the life of  his snake.”   “For Nagini?” <PER>Snape</PER> looked astonished.
If there comes a time when Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>  stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but  keeps it safe beside him under magical protection,  then, I think, it will be safe to tell <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Tell him what?”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill  him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a  shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a fragment of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soul was  blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto  the only living soul left in that collapsing building.
Part of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> lives inside <PER>Harry</PER>, and it is  that which gives him the power of speech with  snakes, and a connection with Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind  that he has never understood.
And while that  fragment of soul, unmissed by <PER>Voldemort</PER>, remains  attached to and protected by <PER>Harry</PER>, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>  cannot die.”         <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be watching the two men from one  end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him,  their voices echoing strangely in his ears.
If I know him, he will  have arranged matters so that when he does set out  to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> opened his eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>  watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded  he turned back to <PER>Snape</PER>, and his eyes were full of  tears.
Now, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> talking  to the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> behind his desk.
“You will have to give <PER>Voldemort</PER> the correct date of  <PER>Harry</PER>’s departure from his aunt and uncle’s,” said  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
...”   Now <PER>Snape</PER> was head to head with Mundungus in an  unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus ’s face looking  curiously blank, <PER>Snape</PER> frowning in concentration.
...   Now <PER>Harry</PER> was flying alongside <PER>Snape</PER> on a  broomstick through a clear dark night: He was  accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and  ahead were Lupin and a <PER>Harry</PER> who was really George.
... A Death Eater moved ahead of <PER>Snape</PER> and raised  his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back —   “ Sectumsemprcd” shouted <PER>Snape</PER>.
If <PER>Voldemort</PER> should read <PER>Harry</PER>’s  mind and see you acting for him — ”   “I know,” said <PER>Snape</PER> curtly.
<PER>Harry</PER> rose up out of the  Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted  floor in exactly the same room: <PER>Snape</PER> might just have  closed the door.
Along the way, he was to dispose of  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s remaining links to life, so that when at  last he flung himself across <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s path, and did  not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be  clean, and the job that ought to have been done in  Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live,  neither could survive.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had      passed the job of destroying them to him, and  obediently he had continued to chip away at the  bonds tying not only <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but himself, to life!
And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had known that <PER>Harry</PER> would not  duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even  though it was his end, because he had taken trouble  to get to know him, hadn’t he?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew, as  <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew, that <PER>Harry</PER> would not let anyone else  die for him now that he had discovered it was in his  power to stop it.
One Horcrux remained to  bind <PER>Voldemort</PER> to the earth, even after <PER>Harry</PER> had  been killed.
... <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> would know what needed to be done, of  course.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed a long way away, in a far-  off country; he felt as though he had parted from  them long ago.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced down and felt another dull  blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage,  must have sneaked back just as <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and  Goyle had done.
People were moving around, trying to  comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the  dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved,  no hint of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, or any of the other  Weasleys, no Luna.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved toward <PER>Neville</PER>, who was bending over  another body.
“<PER>Neville</PER>.”   “Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>, you nearly gave me heart failure!”   <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to  him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make  absolutely sure.
Listen — <PER>Neville</PER> — ”         “<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Neville</PER> looked suddenly scared.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,  you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?”     “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied easily.
You know <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s snake, <PER>Neville</PER>?
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> know that,  but just in case they — ”   The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a  moment, made it impossible to keep talking.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died knowing that three people still  knew about the Horcruxes; now <PER>Neville</PER> would take  <PER>Harry</PER>’s place: There would still be three in the secret.
Thanks, <PER>Neville</PER>.”   But <PER>Neville</PER> seized his wrist as <PER>Harry</PER> made to move  on.
He and <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>,  the abandoned boys, had all found home here.
All those visits to  <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire,  and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great  bearded face, and <PER>Ron</PER> vomiting slugs, and <PER>Hermione</PER>  helping him save Norbert ...
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched the Cloak  tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper      and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, but sure that he would find him.
The dead who walked beside him through  the forest were much more real to him now than the  living back at the castle: <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and  all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he  stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life,  toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Could it be — ?”   Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their  wands flared, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Yaxley and Dolohov  peering into the darkness, directly at the place <PER>Harry</PER>,  his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood.
They had traveled on mere minutes when <PER>Harry</PER> saw  light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into  a clearing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew had been the place where  the monstrous Aragog had once lived.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had frozen where he stood, but his red  eyes had found <PER>Harry</PER>, and he stared as <PER>Harry</PER> moved  toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.
Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking  eagerly from <PER>Voldemort</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, her breast heaving.
And still, <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each  other, and now <PER>Voldemort</PER> tilted his head a little to      the side, considering the boy standing before him,  and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless  mouth.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was struggling, and  Bellatrix was panting, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought inexplicably  of <PER>Ginny</PER>, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips  on his —   <PER>Voldemort</PER> had raised his wand.
Let us walk.”   Stunned, <PER>Harry</PER> followed as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> strode away  from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading  him to two seats that <PER>Harry</PER> had not previously  noticed, set some distance away under that high,  sparkling ceiling.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down in one of  them, and <PER>Harry</PER> fell into the other, staring at his old  headmaster’s face.
I meant to  let him kill me!”   “And that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “will, I think, have  made all the difference.”   Happiness seemed to radiate from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> like  light, like fire: <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen the man so  utterly, so palpably content.
“Go on!”   “So the part of his soul that was in me ...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded still more enthusiastically,  urging <PER>Harry</PER> onward, a broad smile of encouragement  on his face.
Your soul is whole, and completely your own, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “But then ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced over his shoulder to where the small,  maimed creature trembled under the chair.
“But if <PER>Voldemort</PER> used the Killing Curse,” <PER>Harry</PER>  started again, “and nobody died for me this time —  how can I be alive?”   “I think you know,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Are you sure we can’t do anything?”   “There is no help possible.”   “Then explain ... more,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  smiled.
His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and  while that enchantment survives, so do you and so  does <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s one last hope for himself.”       <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> stared at  him.
Why  did my wand break the wand he borrowed?”   “As to that, I cannot be sure.”   “Have a guess, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  laughed.
“What you must understand, <PER>Harry</PER>, is that you and  Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> have journeyed together into realms  of magic hitherto unknown and untested.
“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power  and qualities of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand that night, which is  to say that it contained a little of <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself.
Your  wand now contained the power of your enormous  courage and of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s own deadly skill: What  chance did that poor stick of Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s stand?”   “But if my wand was so powerful, how come  <PER>Hermione</PER> was able to break it?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He killed me with your wand.”   “He failed to kill you with my wand,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>  corrected <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Where would you say that we are?”   Until <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had asked, <PER>Harry</PER> had not known.
This is, as they say,  your party.”   <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what this meant; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was  being infuriating.
“Well?”   For the first time since <PER>Harry</PER> had met <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  he looked less than an old man, much less.
I have known, for some time now,  that you are the better man.”   “What are you talking about?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, startled  by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s tone, by the sudden tears in his  eyes.
You  know.”   “What do I know?”         <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned his whole body to face <PER>Harry</PER>, and  tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes.
Was I  better, ultimately, than <PER>Voldemort</PER>?”   “Of course you were,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yet I too sought a way to  conquer death, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   “Not the way he did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
After all his anger at  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the  high, vaulted ceiling, and defend <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from  himself.
“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through  the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right  down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was  born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s  Hollow.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“True.”     <PER>Harry</PER> waited, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not speak, so he  prompted him.
“I resented it, <PER>Harry</PER>.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stated it baldly, coldly.
...”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked directly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes again.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached out and was glad to find that  he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gradually regained control.
“Oh, not death,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in answer to  <PER>Harry</PER>’s questioning look.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not ask whether  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had ever found out who struck Ariana  dead.
At last he knew  what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have seen when he looked in  the Mirror of Erised, and why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been  so understanding of the fascination it had exercised  over <PER>Harry</PER>.
Perhaps that lie to <PER>Voldemort</PER> was his  attempt to make amends ... to prevent <PER>Voldemort</PER>  from taking the Hallow ...”   "... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?”  suggested <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> dabbed his eyes.
After another short pause <PER>Harry</PER> said, “You tried to  use the Resurrection Stone.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded.
You are  the worthy possessor of the Hallows.”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> patted <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked  up at the old man and smiled; he could not help  himself.
Poor  Severus ...”   “If you planned your death with <PER>Snape</PER>, you meant  him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”   “I admit that was my intention,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,  “but it did not work as I intended, did it?”   “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That bit didn’t work out.”   The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and  <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat without talking for the  longest time yet.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> has the Elder Wand.”       “But you want me to go back?”   “I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “that if you choose to  return, there is a chance that he may be finished for  good.
But I know this, <PER>Harry</PER>, that  you have less to fear from returning here than he  does.”   <PER>Harry</PER> glanced again at the raw-looking thing that  trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the  distant chair.
Or  has this been happening inside my head?”   <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beamed at him, and his voice sounded  loud and strong in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears even though the  bright mist was descending again, obscuring his  figure.
...   “My Lord, let me — ”   “I do not require assistance,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> coldly,  and though he could not see it, <PER>Harry</PER> pictured  Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand.
He  could only lie there, with his heart thumping  traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the  same time noting, small comfort though it was, that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> was wary of approaching him, that  <PER>Voldemort</PER> suspected that all had not gone to plan.
CrucioV’   <PER>Harry</PER> had been expecting it, knew his body would not  be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor;  it must be subjected to humiliation to prove  <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s victory.
<PER>Harry</PER>  could feel <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s arms trembling with the force of  his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon  him as <PER>Hagrid</PER> cradled <PER>Harry</PER> in his arms, and <PER>Harry</PER>         did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to  <PER>Hagrid</PER> that all was not, yet, lost.
“Move,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> stumbled  forward, forcing his way through the close-growing  trees, back through the forest.
Branches caught at  <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his  mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the  darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around  them, and while <PER>Hagrid</PER> sobbed blindly, nobody  looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed  neck of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
“BANE!”   <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unexpected bellow nearly forced <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes  open.
Are yeh happy <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s  — d-dead...?”   <PER>Hagrid</PER> could not continue, but broke down in fresh  tears.
“Stop.”       <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER> must have been forced to  obey <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s command, because he lurched a  little.
Someone passed close by <PER>Harry</PER>, and he knew that it  was <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself because he spoke a moment  later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled  through the grounds, crashing upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s  eardrums.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was so close to him that <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare  open his eyes again.
“Come,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard him move  ahead, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was forced to follow.
Now <PER>Harry</PER>  opened his eyes a fraction, and saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>  striding in front of them, wearing the great snake  Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her      enchanted cage.
...   “<PER>Harry</PER>,” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ... <PER>Harry</PER> ...”   <PER>Harry</PER> shut his eyes tight again.
HARRY!”   <PER>Ron</PER>’s, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s voices were worse  than <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted nothing more than  to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their  cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took  up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the  Death Eaters, until —   “SILENCE!” cried <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and there was a bang  and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced  upon them all.
Set him down, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, at  my feet, where he belongs!”   <PER>Harry</PER> felt himself lowered onto the grass.
“You see?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt him striding  backward and forward right beside the place where he  lay.
“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle  grounds,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and there was relish in his  voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save himself — ”   But <PER>Voldemort</PER> broke off: <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scuffle and a  shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt  of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount.
Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at       <PER>Voldemort</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> saw the figure hit the ground,  Disarmed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> throwing the challenger’s wand  aside and laughing.
The son of  the Aurors, remember?”   “Ah, yes, I remember,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, looking down  at <PER>Neville</PER>, who was struggling back to his feet,  unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man ’s-  land between the survivors and the Death Eaters.
“But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?”  <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked <PER>Neville</PER>, who stood facing him, his  empty hands curled in fists.
We  need your kind, <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom.”   “I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an  answering cheer from the crowd, whom <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.
“Very well,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard more  danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most  powerful curse.
On your head,” he said  quietly, “be it.”       Still watching through his lashes, <PER>Harry</PER> saw  <PER>Voldemort</PER> wave his wand.
Won’t  they, <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom?”   He pointed his wand at <PER>Neville</PER>, who grew rigid and  still, then forced the hat onto <PER>Neville</PER>’s head, so that it  slipped down below his eyes.
“<PER>Neville</PER> here is now going to demonstrate what  happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to  oppose me,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and with a flick of his  wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.
Screams split the dawn, and <PER>Neville</PER> was aflame,  rooted to the spot, unable to move, and <PER>Harry</PER> could  not bear it: He must act —   And then many things happened at the same  moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his  robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet,  as <PER>Neville</PER> moved too.
With a single stroke  <PER>Neville</PER> sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun  high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from  the entrance hall, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mouth was open  in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the  snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet —   Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER> cast a  Shield Charm between <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> before  the latter could raise his wand.
The charging centaurs were scattering  the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants’  stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the  reinforcements that had come from who knew where;  <PER>Harry</PER> saw great winged creatures soaring around the  heads of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak      the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp  punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards,  defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were  being forced back into the castle.
Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER> was  buffeted into the entrance hall: He was searching for  <PER>Voldemort</PER> and saw him across the room, firing spells  from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still  screaming instructions to his followers as he sent  curses flying left and right; <PER>Harry</PER> cast more Shield  Charms, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s would-be victims, Seamus  Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into  the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already  flourishing inside it.
The centaurs Bane, <PER>Ron</PER>an, and  Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of  hooves, as behind <PER>Harry</PER> the door that led to the  kitchens was blasted off its hinges.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and  Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at  Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across  the room by <PER>Hagrid</PER>, hit the stone wall opposite, and  slide unconscious to the ground.
He saw <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Neville</PER> bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth  Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring  Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER> running  through the crowd, not even attempting to fight,  screaming for their son.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was now dueling <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Slughorn,  and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in  his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable  to finish him —   Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and like her master she dueled three at       once: <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna, all battling their  hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s  attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close  to <PER>Ginny</PER> that she missed death by an inch —   He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but before he had gone a few steps he was  knocked sideways.
She is mine!”   Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the  two fights, <PER>Voldemort</PER> and his three opponents,  Bellatrix and Molly, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood, invisible, torn  between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect,  unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw  <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted  backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as  <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant  exploded with the force of a bomb.
“Protego\” roared <PER>Harry</PER>, and the Shield Charm  expanded in the middle of the Hall, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>  stared around for the source as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the  Invisibility Cloak at last.
The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and  completely as <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each  other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each  other.
“You think it will be you, do you, the  boy who has survived by accident, and because  <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was pulling the strings?”   “Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?”  asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
They were still moving sideways, both of  them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same  distance from each other, and for <PER>Harry</PER> no face  existed but <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
Want to hear some, before you make  another big mistake?”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and  <PER>Harry</PER> knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized  and at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that  <PER>Harry</PER> might indeed know a final secret.
“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said  <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “you must believe that you have magic  that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than  mine?”       “I believe both,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and he saw shock flit  across the snakelike face, though it was instantly  dispelled; <PER>Voldemort</PER> began to laugh, and the sound  was more frightening than his screams; humorless  and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.
“Than I, than Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who has performed  magic that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself never dreamed of?”   “Oh, he dreamed of it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but he knew more  than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.”   “You mean he was weak!” screamed <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Too  weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been  his, what will be mine!”   “No, he was cleverer than you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “a better  wizard, a better man.”   “I brought about the death of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!”   “You thought you did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you were  wrong.”   For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the  hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as  one.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> is dead\” <PER>Voldemort</PER> hurled the words at  <PER>Harry</PER> as though they would cause him unendurable  pain.
“His body decays in the marble tomb in the  grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he  will not return!”   “Yes, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly, “but  you didn’t have him killed.
He chose his own manner  of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the         whole thing with the man you thought was your  servant.”   “What childish dream is this?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but  still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver  from <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER> wasn’t yours,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>  was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s from the moment  you started hunting down my mother.
You never saw <PER>Snape</PER> cast a Patronus, did you,  Riddle?”   <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not answer.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s Patronus was a doe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the same  as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of  his life, from the time when they were children.
You  should have realized,” he said as he saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t  he?”   “He desired her, that was all,” sneered <PER>Voldemort</PER>,   “but when she had gone, he agreed that there were  other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him — ”   “Of course he told you that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but he was  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spy from the moment you threatened  her, and he’s been working against you ever since!
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was already dying when <PER>Snape</PER> finished  him!”   “It matters not!” shrieked <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who had  followed every word with rapt attention, but now let  out a cackle of mad laughter.
“It matters not whether  <PER>Snape</PER> was mine or <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, or what petty  obstacles they tried to put in my path!
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s last plan went wrong, <PER>Harry</PER>  Potter!”   “Yeah, it did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
...”   “What is this?”   Of all the things that <PER>Harry</PER> had said to him, beyond  any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked  <PER>Voldemort</PER> like this.
“Yes, I dare,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s last  plan hasn’t backfired on me at all.
It’s backfired on  you, Riddle.”   <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand,  and <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s very tightly.
<PER>Snape</PER> never beat <PER>Dumbledore</PER>l  <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death was planned between them!
If all had gone as planned, the  wand’s power would have died with him, because it  had never been won from him!”   “But then, Potter, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as good as gave me the  wand!” <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice shook with malicious  pleasure.
...”   <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and <PER>Harry</PER>  could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the  wand pointed at his face.
“The true master of the Elder Wand was <PER>Malfoy</PER>  <PER>Malfoy</PER>.”         Blank shock showed in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face for a  moment, but then it was gone.
You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel  on skill alone ... and after I have killed you, I can  attend to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the high  voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the  heavens, pointing <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand:   “Avada KedavraV’   “ Expelliarmus\ ”   The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden  flames that erupted between them, at the dead center  of the circle they had been treading, marked the point  where the spells collided.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s  green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly  high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the      enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning  through the air toward the master it would not kill,  who had come to take full possession of it at last.
And  <PER>Harry</PER>, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught  the wand in his free hand as <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell backward,  arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling  upward.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was dead, killed by his own  rebounding curse, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood with two wands in  his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.
The fierce new sun  dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him,  and the first to reach him were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  and it was their arms that were wrapped around him,  their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him.
Then <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna were there, and then  all the Weasleys and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and Kingsley and  <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick and Sprout, and <PER>Harry</PER> could  not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell  whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to  hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in,  all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived,  the reason it was over at last —   The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great  Hall blazed with life and light.
“Will you come with me?”   They stood up at once, and together he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and  <PER>Hermione</PER> left the Great Hall.
“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the  thing, doesn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing open a door to  let <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> through.
But  first he owed an explanation to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>,  who had stuck with him for so long, and who  deserved the truth.
Does anyone else know where it fell?”   “No one,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded his  satisfaction.
“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said  <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beamed.
“But of course, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is yours forever, until you  pass it on!”   “And then there’s this.”   <PER>Harry</PER> held up the Elder Wand, and <PER>Ron</PER> and  <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at it with a reverence that, even in         his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, <PER>Harry</PER> did not  like to see.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
Their faces  only came into focus when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Lily, and  Albus had drawn right up to them.
“Parked all right, then?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
She thought I’d have to Confund the  examiner.”   “No, I didn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “I had complete faith in  you.”   “As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” <PER>Ron</PER>  whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>, as together they lifted Albus ’s  trunk and owl onto the train.
“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said  <PER>Ron</PER>, “but no pressure.”   “<PER>Ron</PER>\”   Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked  solemn.
“He doesn’t mean it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, but  <PER>Ron</PER> was no longer paying attention.
“Look who it is.”   <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing there with his wife and  son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat.
The new boy resembled <PER>Malfoy</PER> as much  as Albus resembled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> caught sight of  <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> staring at him,  nodded curtly, and turned away again.
Thank  God you inherited your mother’s brains.”   “<PER>Ron</PER>, for heaven’s sake,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, half stern,  half amused.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”   “Don’t forget to give <PER>Neville</PER> our love!” <PER>Ginny</PER> told  James as she hugged him.
“Albus Severus,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly, so that nobody  but <PER>Ginny</PER> could hear, and she was tactful enough to  pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the  train, “you were named for two headmasters of  Hogwarts.
